      "Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou \n",
      "Like consort to thyself canst no where find. \n",
      "That day I oft remember, when from sleep \n",
      "I first awaked, and found myself reposed \n",
      "Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where \n",
      "And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. \n",
      "Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound \n",
      "Of waters issued from a cave, and spread \n",
      "Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved \n",
      "Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went \n",
      "With unexperienced thought, and laid me down \n",
      "On the green bank, to look into the clear \n",
      "Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky. \n",
      "As I bent down to look, just opposite \n",
      "A shape within the watery gleam appeared, \n",
      "Bending to look on me:  I started back, \n",
      "It started back; but pleased I soon returned, \n",
      "Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks \n",
      "Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed \n",
      "Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, \n",
      "Had not a voice thus warned me;  'What thou seest, \n",
      "'What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself; \n",
      "'With thee it came and goes: but follow me, \n",

      "Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall, \n",
      "Under a platane; yet methought less fair, \n",
      "Less winning soft, less amiably mild, \n",
      "Than that smooth watery image:  Back I turned; \n",
      "Thou following cryedst aloud, 'Return, fair Eve; \n",
      "'Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest, of him thou art, \n",
      "'His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent \n",

      "How beauty is excelled by manly grace, \n",
      "And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. \n",
      "So spake our general mother, and with eyes \n",
      "Of conjugal attraction unreproved, \n",
      "And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned \n",
      "On our first father; half her swelling breast \n",
      "Naked met his, under the flowing gold \n",
      "Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight \n",
      "Both of her beauty, and submissive charms, \n",
      "Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter \n",
      "On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds \n",
      "That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip \n",
      "With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned \n",
      "For envy; yet with jealous leer malign \n",
      "Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained. \n",

      "Can it be death?  And do they only stand \n",
      "By ignorance?  Is that their happy state, \n",
      "The proof of their obedience and their faith? \n",
      "O fair foundation laid whereon to build \n",

      "This garden, and no corner leave unspied; \n",
      "A chance but chance may lead where I may meet \n",
      "Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side, \n",
      "Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw \n",
      "What further would be learned.  Live while ye may, \n",

      "Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed! \n",
      "So saying, his proud step he scornful turned, \n",

      "Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven \n",

      "Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent \n",
      "Accessible from earth, one entrance high; \n",
      "The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung \n",
      "Still as it rose, impossible to climb. \n",
      "Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat, \n",
      "Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night; \n",
      "About him exercised heroick games \n",
      "The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand \n",
      "Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears, \n",
      "Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. \n",
      "Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even \n",
      "On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star \n",
      "In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired \n",

      "Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place \n",
      "No evil thing approach or enter in. \n",
      "This day at highth of noon came to my sphere \n",
      "A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know \n",
      "More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man, \n",
      "God's latest image:  I described his way \n",
      "Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait; \n",
      "But in the mount that lies from Eden north, \n",
      "Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks \n",
      "Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured: \n",
      "Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade \n",
      "Lost sight of him:  One of the banished crew, \n",
      "I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise \n",
      "New troubles; him thy care must be to find. \n",

      "And of their doings God takes no account. \n",
      "To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east \n",

      "More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth: \n",
      "Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums, \n",
      "That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth, \n",

      "When first on this delightful land he spreads \n",
      "His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower, \n",
      "Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth \n",

      "To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. \n",
      "Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, \n",
      "Or undiminished brightness to be known, \n",
      "As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; \n",
      "That glory then, when thou no more wast good, \n",
      "Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now \n",
      "Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. \n",
      "But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account \n",
      "To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep \n",
      "This place inviolable, and these from harm. \n",
      "So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, \n",
      "Severe in youthful beauty, added grace \n",

      "Best with the best, the sender, not the sent, \n",
      "Or all at once; more glory will be won, \n",
      "Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold, \n",
      "Will save us trial what the least can do \n",
      "Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. \n",
      "The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; \n",
      "But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, \n",
      "Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly \n",
      "He held it vain; awe from above had quelled \n",
      "His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh \n",
      "The western point, where those half-rounding guards \n",
      "Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, \n",
      "A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, \n",
      "Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. \n",
      "O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet \n",
      "Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern \n",
      "Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; \n",
      "And with them comes a third of regal port, \n",
      "But faded splendour wan; who by his gait \n",
      "And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, \n",
      "Not likely to part hence without contest; \n",
      "Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. \n",
      "He scarce had ended, when those two approached, \n",
      "And brief related whom they brought, where found, \n",
      "How busied, in what form and posture couched. \n",
      "To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. \n",
      "Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed \n",
      "To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge \n",
      "Of others, who approve not to transgress \n",
      "By thy example, but have power and right \n",
      "To question thy bold entrance on this place; \n",
      "Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those \n",
      "Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! \n",
      "To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. \n",
      "Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, \n",
      "And such I held thee; but this question asked \n",
      "Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain! \n",
      "Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, \n",
      "Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt \n",
      "And boldly venture to whatever place \n",
      "Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change \n",
      "Torment with ease, and soonest recompense \n",
      "Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; \n",
      "To thee no reason, who knowest only good, \n",

      "His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar \n",
      "His iron gates, if he intends our stay \n",

      "But that implies not violence or harm. \n",
      "Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved, \n",
      "Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. \n",
      "O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise \n",
      "Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew, \n",
      "And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, \n",
      "Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise \n",
      "Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither \n",
      "Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed; \n",
      "So wise he judges it to fly from pain \n",
      "However, and to 'scape his punishment! \n",
      "So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath, \n",
      "Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight \n",
      "Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, \n",
      "Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain \n",

      "To thy deserted host this cause of flight, \n",
      "Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. \n",
      "To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. \n",
      "Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, \n",
      "Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood \n",
      "Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid \n",
      "The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, \n",
      "And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. \n",
      "But still thy words at random, as before, \n",
      "Argue thy inexperience what behoves \n",
      "From hard assays and ill successes past \n",
      "A faithful leader, not to hazard all \n",
      "Through ways of danger by himself untried: \n",
      "I, therefore, I alone first undertook \n",
      "To wing the desolate abyss, and spy \n",
      "This new created world, whereof in Hell \n",
      "Fame is not silent, here in hope to find \n",
      "Better abode, and my afflicted Powers \n",
      "To settle here on earth, or in mid air; \n",
      "Though for possession put to try once more \n",
      "What thou and thy gay legions dare against; \n",
      "Whose easier business were to serve their Lord \n",
      "High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, \n",
      "And practised distances to cringe, not fight, \n",
      "To whom the warriour Angel soon replied. \n",
      "To say and straight unsay, pretending first \n",
      "Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy, \n",
      "Argues no leader but a liear traced, \n",
      "Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name, \n",
      "O sacred name of faithfulness profaned! \n",
      "Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? \n",
      "Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. \n",
      "Was this your discipline and faith engaged, \n",
      "Your military obedience, to dissolve \n",
      "Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? \n",

      "Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored \n",
      "Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope \n",
      "To dispossess him, and thyself to reign? \n",
      "But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant; \n",
      "Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour \n",
      "Within these hallowed limits thou appear, \n",
      "Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained, \n",
      "And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn \n",
      "The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred. \n",
      "So threatened he; but Satan to no threats \n",
      "Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. \n",
      "Then when I am thy captive talk of chains, \n",
      "Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then \n",
      "Far heavier load thyself expect to feel \n",
      "From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King \n",
      "Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, \n",
      "Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels \n",
      "In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. \n",
      "While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright \n",
      "Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns \n",
      "Their phalanx, and began to hem him round \n",
      "With ported spears, as thick as when a field \n",
      "Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends \n",
      "Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind \n",
      "Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, \n",
      "Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves \n",
      "Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed, \n",
      "Collecting all his might, dilated stood, \n",
      "Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: \n",
      "His stature reached the sky, and on his crest \n",
      "Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp \n",
      "What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds \n",
      "Might have ensued, nor only Paradise \n",
      "In this commotion, but the starry cope \n",
      "Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements \n",
      "At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn \n",
      "With violence of this conflict, had not soon \n",
      "The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, \n",

      "In counterpoise, now ponders all events, \n",
      "Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights, \n",
      "The sequel each of parting and of fight: \n",
      "The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam, \n",
      "Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. \n",
      "Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; \n",
      "Neither our own, but given:  What folly then \n",
      "To boast what arms can do? since thine no more \n",
      "Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now \n",
      "To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up, \n",
      "And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; \n",
      "Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak, \n",
      "If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew \n",
      "His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more;but fled \n",
      "Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. \n",

      "To match with their inventions they presumed \n",
      "So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn, \n",
      "And all his host derided, while they stood \n",
      "A while in trouble:  But they stood not long; \n",
      "Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms \n",
      "Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. \n",
      "Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, \n",
      "Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!) \n",

      "Main promontories flung, which in the air \n",
      "Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed; \n",
      "Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised \n",
      "Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain \n",

      "Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. \n",
      "The rest, in imitation, to like arms \n",
      "Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore: \n",
      "So hills amid the air encountered hills, \n",
      "Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire; \n",
      "That under ground they fought in dismal shade; \n",

      "Upon his enemies, and to declare \n",
      "All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son, \n",

      "And in whose hand what by decree I do, \n",
      "Second Omnipotence! two days are past, \n",
      "Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven, \n",
      "Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame \n",
      "These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight, \n",
      "As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed; \n",
      "For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest, \n",
      "Equal in their creation they were formed, \n",
      "Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought \n",
      "Insensibly, for I suspend their doom; \n",

      "War wearied hath performed what war can do, \n",
      "And to disordered rage let loose the reins \n",
      "With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes \n",

      "Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; \n",
      "For thee I have ordained it; and thus far \n",
      "Have suffered, that the glory may be thine \n",
      "Of ending this great war, since none but Thou \n",

      "Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled; \n",
      "To their prepared ill mansion driven down, \n",
      "To chains of darkness, and the undying worm; \n",
      "That from thy just obedience could revolt, \n",
      "Whom to obey is happiness entire. \n",
      "Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure \n",
      "Far separate, circling thy holy mount, \n",
      "Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, \n",
      "Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief. \n",
      "So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose \n",
      "From the right hand of Glory where he sat; \n",
      "And the third sacred morn began to shine, \n",
      "Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound \n",
      "The chariot of Paternal Deity, \n",
      "Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, \n",
      "Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed \n",
      "By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each \n",
      "Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all \n",
      "And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels \n",
      "Of beryl, and careering fires between; \n",
      "Over their heads a crystal firmament, \n",
      "Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure \n",
      "Amber, and colours of the showery arch. \n",
      "He, in celestial panoply all armed \n",
      "Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, \n",
      "Ascended; at his right hand Victory \n",
      "Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow \n",
      "And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; \n",
      "And from about him fierce effusion rolled \n",
      "Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: \n",
      "Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, \n",
      "He onward came; far off his coming shone; \n",
      "And twenty thousand (I their number heard) \n",
      "Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; \n",
      "He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime \n",
      "On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, \n",
      "Illustrious far and wide; but by his own \n",
      "First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, \n",
      "When the great ensign of Messiah blazed \n",
      "Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; \n",
      "Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced \n",
      "His army, circumfused on either wing, \n",
      "Under their Head imbodied all in one. \n",
      "Before him Power Divine his way prepared; \n",
      "At his command the uprooted hills retired \n",
      "Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went \n",
      "Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, \n",
      "And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. \n",
      "This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, \n",
      "And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, \n",
      "Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. \n",
      "In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? \n",
      "But to convince the proud what signs avail, \n",
      "Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? \n",
      "They, hardened more by what might most reclaim, \n",
      "Grieving to see his glory, at the sight \n",
      "Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth, \n",
      "Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud \n",
      "Weening to prosper, and at length prevail \n",
      "Against God and Messiah, or to fall \n",
      "In universal ruin last; and now \n",
      "To final battle drew, disdaining flight, \n",
      "Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God \n",
      "To all his host on either hand thus spake. \n",
      "Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, \n",
      "Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest: \n",
      "Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God \n",
      "Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause; \n",
      "And as ye have received, so have ye done, \n",
      "Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew \n",
      "The punishment to other hand belongs; \n",
      "Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: \n",
      "Number to this day's work is not ordained, \n",
      "Nor multitude; stand only, and behold \n",
      "God's indignation on these godless poured \n",
      "By me; not you, but me, they have despised, \n",
      "Yet envied; against me is all their rage, \n",
      "Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme \n",
      "Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains, \n",
      "Hath honoured me, according to his will. \n",
      "Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; \n",
      "That they may have their wish, to try with me \n",
      "In battle which the stronger proves; they all, \n",
      "Or I alone against them; since by strength \n",
      "They measure all, of other excellence \n",
      "Not emulous, nor care who them excels; \n",
      "Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. \n",
      "So spake the Son, and into terrour changed \n",
      "His countenance too severe to be beheld, \n",
      "And full of wrath bent on his enemies. \n",
      "At once the Four spread out their starry wings \n",
      "With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs \n",
      "Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound \n",
      "Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. \n",
      "He on his impious foes right onward drove, \n",
      "Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels \n",
      "The stedfast empyrean shook throughout, \n",
      "All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon \n",
      "Among them he arrived; in his right hand \n",
      "Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent \n",
      "Before him, such as in their souls infixed \n",
      "Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost, \n",
      "All courage; down their idle weapons dropt: \n",
      "O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode \n",
      "Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, \n",
      "That wished the mountains now might be again \n",
      "Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire. \n",
      "Nor less on either side tempestuous fell \n",
      "His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four \n",
      "Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels \n",
      "Distinct alike with multitude of eyes; \n",
      "One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye \n",
      "Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire \n",
      "Among the accursed, that withered all their strength, \n",

      "Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe, \n",

      "When from the boughs a savoury odour blown, \n",

      "That dwelt within, whose presence had infused \n",
      "Into the plant sciential sap, derived \n",

      "Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay? \n",
      "Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived \n",

      "Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown \n",
      "Opening the way, but of divine effect \n",

      "Reasoning to admiration; and with me \n",
      "Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I \n",

      "The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes, \n",
      "Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, \n",
      "And growing up to Godhead; which for thee \n",
      "Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. \n",
      "For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; \n",
      "Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. \n",

thou from the first \\nWast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, \\nDove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss, \\nAnd mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark \\nIllumine, what is low raise and support; \\nThat, to the height of this great argument, \\nI may assert Eternal Providence, \\nAnd justify the ways of God to men\", ' \\n  Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, \\nNor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause \\nMoved our grand parents, in that happy state, \\nFavoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off \\nFrom their Creator, and transgress his will \\nFor one restraint, lords of the World besides', ' \\nWho first seduced them to that foul revolt', \" \\n  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, \\nStirred up with envy and revenge, deceived \\nThe mother of mankind, what time his pride \\nHad cast him out from Heaven, with all his host \\nOf rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring \\nTo set himself in glory above his peers, \\nHe trusted to have equalled the Most High, \\nIf he opposed, and with ambitious aim \\nAgainst the throne and monarchy of God, \\nRaised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, \\nWith vain attempt\", \" Him the Almighty Power \\nHurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, \\nWith hideous ruin and combustion, down \\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell \\nIn adamantine chains and penal fire, \\nWho durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms\", ' \\n  Nine times the space that measures day and night \\nTo mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, \\nLay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, \\nConfounded, though immortal', ' But his doom \\nReserved him to more wrath; for now the thought \\nBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain \\nTorments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, \\nThat witnessed huge affliction and dismay, \\nMixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate', ' \\nAt once, as far as Angels ken, he views \\nThe dismal situation waste and wild', ' \\nA dungeon horrible, on all sides round, \\nAs one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames \\nNo light; but rather darkness visible \\nServed only to discover sights of woe, \\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace \\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes \\nThat comes to all, but torture without end \\nStill urges, and a fiery deluge, fed \\nWith ever-burning sulphur unconsumed', \" \\nSuch place Eternal Justice has prepared \\nFor those rebellious; here their prison ordained \\nIn utter darkness, and their portion set, \\nAs far removed from God and light of Heaven \\nAs from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole\", ' \\nOh how unlike the place from whence they fell', \" \\nThere the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed \\nWith floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, \\nHe soon discerns; and, weltering by his side, \\nOne next himself in power, and next in crime, \\nLong after known in Palestine, and named \\nBeelzebub\", ' To whom th\\' Arch-Enemy, \\nAnd thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words \\nBreaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- \\n  \"If thou beest he--but O how fallen', ' how changed \\nFrom him who, in the happy realms of light \\nClothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine \\nMyriads, though bright', '--if he whom mutual league, \\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope \\nAnd hazard in the glorious enterprise \\nJoined with me once, now misery hath joined \\nIn equal ruin; into what pit thou seest \\nFrom what height fallen: so much the stronger proved \\nHe with his thunder; and till then who knew \\nThe force of those dire arms', ' Yet not for those, \\nNor what the potent Victor in his rage \\nCan else inflict, do I repent, or change, \\nThough changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind, \\nAnd high disdain from sense of injured merit, \\nThat with the Mightiest raised me to contend, \\nAnd to the fierce contentions brought along \\nInnumerable force of Spirits armed, \\nThat durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, \\nHis utmost power with adverse power opposed \\nIn dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, \\nAnd shook his throne', ' What though the field be lost', ' \\nAll is not lost--the unconquerable will, \\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate, \\nAnd courage never to submit or yield: \\nAnd what is else not to be overcome', ' \\nThat glory never shall his wrath or might \\nExtort from me', \" To bow and sue for grace \\nWith suppliant knee, and deify his power \\nWho, from the terror of this arm, so late \\nDoubted his empire--that were low indeed; \\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath \\nThis downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, \\nAnd this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; \\nSince, through experience of this great event, \\nIn arms not worse, in foresight much advanced, \\nWe may with more successful hope resolve \\nTo wage by force or guile eternal war, \\nIrreconcilable to our grand Foe, \\nWho now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy \\nSole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven\", '\" \\n  So spake th\\' apostate Angel, though in pain, \\nVaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair; \\nAnd him thus answered soon his bold compeer:-- \\n  \"O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers \\nThat led th\\' embattled Seraphim to war \\nUnder thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds \\nFearless, endangered Heaven\\'s perpetual King, \\nAnd put to proof his high supremacy, \\nWhether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, \\nToo well I see and rue the dire event \\nThat, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, \\nHath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host \\nIn horrible destruction laid thus low, \\nAs far as Gods and heavenly Essences \\nCan perish: for the mind and spirit remains \\nInvincible, and vigour soon returns, \\nThough all our glory extinct, and happy state \\nHere swallowed up in endless misery', \" \\nBut what if he our Conqueror (whom I now \\nOf force believe almighty, since no less \\nThan such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) \\nHave left us this our spirit and strength entire, \\nStrongly to suffer and support our pains, \\nThat we may so suffice his vengeful ire, \\nOr do him mightier service as his thralls \\nBy right of war, whate'er his business be, \\nHere in the heart of Hell to work in fire, \\nOr do his errands in the gloomy Deep\", ' \\nWhat can it the avail though yet we feel \\nStrength undiminished, or eternal being \\nTo undergo eternal punishment', '\" \\n  Whereto with speedy words th\\' Arch-Fiend replied:-- \\n\"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable, \\nDoing or suffering: but of this be sure-- \\nTo do aught good never will be our task, \\nBut ever to do ill our sole delight, \\nAs being the contrary to his high will \\nWhom we resist', ' If then his providence \\nOut of our evil seek to bring forth good, \\nOur labour must be to pervert that end, \\nAnd out of good still to find means of evil; \\nWhich ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps \\nShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb \\nHis inmost counsels from their destined aim', ' \\nBut see', \" the angry Victor hath recalled \\nHis ministers of vengeance and pursuit \\nBack to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail, \\nShot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid \\nThe fiery surge that from the precipice \\nOf Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, \\nWinged with red lightning and impetuous rage, \\nPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now \\nTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep\", \" \\nLet us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn \\nOr satiate fury yield it from our Foe\", ' \\nSeest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, \\nThe seat of desolation, void of light, \\nSave what the glimmering of these livid flames \\nCasts pale and dreadful', ' Thither let us tend \\nFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves; \\nThere rest, if any rest can harbour there; \\nAnd, re-assembling our afflicted powers, \\nConsult how we may henceforth most offend \\nOur enemy, our own loss how repair, \\nHow overcome this dire calamity, \\nWhat reinforcement we may gain from hope, \\nIf not, what resolution from despair', '\" \\n  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, \\nWith head uplift above the wave, and eyes \\nThat sparkling blazed; his other parts besides \\nProne on the flood, extended long and large, \\nLay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge \\nAs whom the fables name of monstrous size, \\nTitanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove, \\nBriareos or Typhon, whom the den \\nBy ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast \\nLeviathan, which God of all his works \\nCreated hugest that swim th\\' ocean-stream', ' \\nHim, haply slumbering on the Norway foam, \\nThe pilot of some small night-foundered skiff, \\nDeeming some island, oft, as seamen tell, \\nWith fixed anchor in his scaly rind, \\nMoors by his side under the lee, while night \\nInvests the sea, and wished morn delays', ' \\nSo stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay, \\nChained on the burning lake; nor ever thence \\nHad risen, or heaved his head, but that the will \\nAnd high permission of all-ruling Heaven \\nLeft him at large to his own dark designs, \\nThat with reiterated crimes he might \\nHeap on himself damnation, while he sought \\nEvil to others, and enraged might see \\nHow all his malice served but to bring forth \\nInfinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn \\nOn Man by him seduced, but on himself \\nTreble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured', \" \\n  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool \\nHis mighty stature; on each hand the flames \\nDriven backward slope their pointing spires, and,rolled \\nIn billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale\", ' \\nThen with expanded wings he steers his flight \\nAloft, incumbent on the dusky air, \\nThat felt unusual weight; till on dry land \\nHe lights--if it were land that ever burned \\nWith solid, as the lake with liquid fire, \\nAnd such appeared in hue as when the force \\nOf subterranean wind transprots a hill \\nTorn from Pelorus, or the shattered side \\nOf thundering Etna, whose combustible \\nAnd fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire, \\nSublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds, \\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involved \\nWith stench and smoke', ' Such resting found the sole \\nOf unblest feet', ' Him followed his next mate; \\nBoth glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood \\nAs gods, and by their own recovered strength, \\nNot by the sufferance of supernal Power', ' \\n  \"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,\" \\nSaid then the lost Archangel, \"this the seat \\nThat we must change for Heaven', '--this mournful gloom \\nFor that celestial light', ' Be it so, since he \\nWho now is sovereign can dispose and bid \\nWhat shall be right: farthest from him is best \\nWhom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme \\nAbove his equals', ' Farewell, happy fields, \\nWhere joy for ever dwells', ' Hail, horrors', ' hail, \\nInfernal world', ' and thou, profoundest Hell, \\nReceive thy new possessor--one who brings \\nA mind not to be changed by place or time', ' \\nThe mind is its own place, and in itself \\nCan make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven', ' \\nWhat matter where, if I be still the same, \\nAnd what I should be, all but less than he \\nWhom thunder hath made greater', \" Here at least \\nWe shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built \\nHere for his envy, will not drive us hence: \\nHere we may reigh secure; and, in my choice, \\nTo reign is worth ambition, though in Hell: \\nBetter to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven\", \" \\nBut wherefore let we then our faithful friends, \\nTh' associates and co-partners of our loss, \\nLie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool, \\nAnd call them not to share with us their part \\nIn this unhappy mansion, or once more \\nWith rallied arms to try what may be yet \\nRegained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell\", '\" \\n  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub \\nThus answered:--\"Leader of those armies bright \\nWhich, but th\\' Omnipotent, none could have foiled', ' \\nIf once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge \\nOf hope in fears and dangers--heard so oft \\nIn worst extremes, and on the perilous edge \\nOf battle, when it raged, in all assaults \\nTheir surest signal--they will soon resume \\nNew courage and revive, though now they lie \\nGrovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire, \\nAs we erewhile, astounded and amazed; \\nNo wonder, fallen such a pernicious height', '\" \\n  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend \\nWas moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield, \\nEthereal temper, massy, large, and round, \\nBehind him cast', ' The broad circumference \\nHung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb \\nThrough optic glass the Tuscan artist views \\nAt evening, from the top of Fesole, \\nOr in Valdarno, to descry new lands, \\nRivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe', \" \\nHis spear--to equal which the tallest pine \\nHewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast \\nOf some great ammiral, were but a wand-- \\nHe walked with, to support uneasy steps \\nOver the burning marl, not like those steps \\nOn Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime \\nSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire\", \" \\nNathless he so endured, till on the beach \\nOf that inflamed sea he stood, and called \\nHis legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced \\nThick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks \\nIn Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades \\nHigh over-arched embower; or scattered sedge \\nAfloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed \\nHath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew \\nBusiris and his Memphian chivalry, \\nWhile with perfidious hatred they pursued \\nThe sojourners of Goshen, who beheld \\nFrom the safe shore their floating carcases \\nAnd broken chariot-wheels\", ' So thick bestrown, \\nAbject and lost, lay these, covering the flood, \\nUnder amazement of their hideous change', ' \\nHe called so loud that all the hollow deep \\nOf Hell resounded:--\"Princes, Potentates, \\nWarriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost, \\nIf such astonishment as this can seize \\nEternal Spirits', ' Or have ye chosen this place \\nAfter the toil of battle to repose \\nYour wearied virtue, for the ease you find \\nTo slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven', \" \\nOr in this abject posture have ye sworn \\nTo adore the Conqueror, who now beholds \\nCherub and Seraph rolling in the flood \\nWith scattered arms and ensigns, till anon \\nHis swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern \\nTh' advantage, and, descending, tread us down \\nThus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts \\nTransfix us to the bottom of this gulf\", ' \\nAwake, arise, or be for ever fallen', '\" \\n  They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung \\nUpon the wing, as when men wont to watch \\nOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, \\nRouse and bestir themselves ere well awake', \" \\nNor did they not perceive the evil plight \\nIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;

\\nAnd we have yet large day, for scarce the sun \\nHath finished half his journey, and scarce begins \\nHis other half in the great zone of Heaven', ' \\nThus Adam made request; and Raphael, \\nAfter short pause assenting, thus began', ' \\nHigh matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men, \\nSad task and hard:  For how shall I relate \\nTo human sense the invisible exploits \\nOf warring Spirits', ' how, without remorse, \\nThe ruin of so many glorious once \\nAnd perfect while they stood', ' how last unfold \\nThe secrets of another world, perhaps \\nNot lawful to reveal', ' yet for thy good \\nThis is dispensed;

for great indeed \\nHis name, and high was his degree in Heaven; \\nHis countenance, as the morning-star that guides \\nThe starry flock, allured them, and with lies \\nDrew after him the third part of Heaven's host\", ' \\nMean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns \\nAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount, \\nAnd from within the golden lamps that burn \\nNightly before him, saw without their light \\nRebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread \\nAmong the sons of morn, what multitudes \\nWere banded to oppose his high decree; \\nAnd, smiling, to his only Son thus said', ' \\nSon, thou in whom my glory I behold \\nIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might, \\nNearly it now concerns us to be sure \\nOf our Omnipotence, and with what arms \\nWe mean to hold what anciently we claim \\nOf deity or empire:  Such a foe \\nIs rising, who intends to erect his throne \\nEqual to ours, throughout the spacious north;

such as, to set forth \\nGreat things by small, if, nature's concord broke, \\nAmong the constellations war were sprung, \\nTwo planets, rushing from aspect malign \\nOf fiercest opposition, in mid sky \\nShould combat, and their jarring spheres confound\", ' \\nTogether both with next to almighty arm \\nUp-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed \\nThat might determine, and not need repeat, \\nAs not of power at once; nor odds appeared \\nIn might or swift prevention:  But the sword \\nOf Michael from the armoury of God \\nWas given him tempered so, that neither keen \\nNor solid might resist that edge: it met \\nThe sword of Satan, with steep force to smite \\nDescending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid, \\nBut with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared \\nAll his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain, \\nAnd writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore \\nThe griding sword with discontinuous wound \\nPassed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed, \\nNot long divisible; and from the gash \\nA stream of necturous humour issuing flowed \\nSanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed, \\nAnd all his armour stained, ere while so bright', ' \\nForthwith on all sides to his aid was run \\nBy Angels many and strong, who interposed \\nDefence, while others bore him on their shields \\nBack to his chariot, where it stood retired \\nFrom off the files of war:  There they him laid \\nGnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame, \\nTo find himself not matchless, and his pride \\nHumbled by such rebuke, so far beneath \\nHis confidence to equal God in power', ' \\nYet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout \\nVital in every part, not as frail man \\nIn entrails, heart of head, liver or reins, \\nCannot but by annihilating die; \\nNor in their liquid texture mortal wound \\nReceive, no more than can the fluid air: \\nAll heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear, \\nAll intellect, all sense;

when to right and left the front \\nDivided, and to either flank retired: \\nWhich to our eyes discovered, new and strange, \\nA triple mounted row of pillars laid \\nOn wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed, \\nOr hollowed bodies made of oak or fir, \\nWith branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,) \\nBrass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths \\nWith hideous orifice gaped on us wide, \\nPortending hollow truce:  At each behind \\nA Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed \\nStood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense, \\nCollected stood within our thoughts amused, \\nNot long; for sudden all at once their reeds \\nPut forth, and to a narrow vent applied \\nWith nicest touch', '  Immediate in a flame, \\nBut soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, \\nFrom those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar \\nEmbowelled with outrageous noise the air, \\nAnd all her entrails tore, disgorging foul \\nTheir devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail \\nOf iron globes; which, on the victor host \\nLevelled, with such impetuous fury smote, \\nThat, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand, \\nThough standing else as rocks, but down they fell \\nBy thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;

\\nAnd the third sacred morn began to shine, \\nDawning through Heaven\", '  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound \\nThe chariot of Paternal Deity, \\nFlashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, \\nItself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed \\nBy four Cherubick shapes; four faces each \\nHad wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all \\nAnd wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels \\nOf beryl, and careering fires between; \\nOver their heads a crystal firmament, \\nWhereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure \\nAmber, and colours of the showery arch', ' \\nHe, in celestial panoply all armed \\nOf radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, \\nAscended; at his right hand Victory \\nSat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow \\nAnd quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; \\nAnd from about him fierce effusion rolled \\nOf smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: \\nAttended with ten thousand thousand Saints, \\nHe onward came; far off his coming shone; \\nAnd twenty thousand (I their number heard) \\nChariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; \\nHe on the wings of Cherub rode sublime \\nOn the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, \\nIllustrious far and wide; but by his own \\nFirst seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, \\nWhen the great ensign of Messiah blazed \\nAloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; \\nUnder whose conduct Michael soon reduced \\nHis army, circumfused on either wing, \\nUnder their Head imbodied all in one', ' \\nBefore him Power Divine his way prepared; \\nAt his command the uprooted hills retired \\nEach to his place; they heard his voice, and went \\nObsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, \\nAnd with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled', ' \\nThis saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, \\nAnd to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, \\nInsensate, hope conceiving from despair', ' \\nIn heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell', ' \\nBut to convince the proud what signs avail, \\nOr wonders move the obdurate to relent', ' \\nThey, hardened more by what might most reclaim, \\nGrieving to see his glory, at the sight \\nTook envy; and, aspiring to his highth, \\nStood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud \\nWeening to prosper, and at length prevail \\nAgainst God and Messiah, or to fall \\nIn universal ruin last; and now \\nTo final battle drew, disdaining flight, \\nOr faint retreat; when the great Son of God \\nTo all his host on either hand thus spake', \" \\nStand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, \\nYe Angels armed; this day from battle rest: \\nFaithful hath been your warfare, and of God \\nAccepted, fearless in his righteous cause; \\nAnd as ye have received, so have ye done, \\nInvincibly:  But of this cursed crew \\nThe punishment to other hand belongs; \\nVengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: \\nNumber to this day's work is not ordained, \\nNor multitude; stand only, and behold \\nGod's indignation on these godless poured \\nBy me; not you, but me, they have despised, \\nYet envied; against me is all their rage, \\nBecause the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme \\nKingdom, and power, and glory appertains, \\nHath honoured me, according to his will\", ' \\nTherefore to me their doom he hath assigned; \\nThat they may have their wish, to try with me \\nIn battle which the stronger proves; they all, \\nOr I alone against them; since by strength \\nThey measure all, of other excellence \\nNot emulous, nor care who them excels; \\nNor other strife with them do I vouchsafe', ' \\nSo spake the Son, and into terrour changed \\nHis countenance too severe to be beheld, \\nAnd full of wrath bent on his enemies', ' \\nAt once the Four spread out their starry wings \\nWith dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs \\nOf his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound \\nOf torrent floods, or of a numerous host', ' \\nHe on his impious foes right onward drove, \\nGloomy as night; under his burning wheels \\nThe stedfast empyrean shook throughout, \\nAll but the throne itself of God', \"  Full soon \\nAmong them he arrived; in his right hand \\nGrasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent \\nBefore him, such as in their souls infixed \\nPlagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost, \\nAll courage; down their idle weapons dropt: \\nO'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode \\nOf Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, \\nThat wished the mountains now might be again \\nThrown on them, as a shelter from his ire\", ' \\nNor less on either side tempestuous fell \\nHis arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four \\nDistinct with eyes, and from the living wheels \\nDistinct alike with multitude of eyes; \\nOne Spirit in them ruled; and every eye \\nGlared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire \\nAmong the accursed, that withered all their strength, \\nAnd of their wonted vigour left them drained, \\nExhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen', ' \\nYet half his strength he put not forth, but checked \\nHis thunder in mid volley; for he meant \\nNot to destroy, but root them out of Heaven: \\nThe overthrown he raised, and as a herd \\nOf goats or timorous flock together thronged \\nDrove them before him thunder-struck, pursued \\nWith terrours, and with furies, to the bounds \\nAnd crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, \\nRolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed \\nInto the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight \\nStruck them with horrour backward, but far worse \\nUrged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw \\nDown from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath \\nBurnt after them to the bottomless pit', ' \\nHell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw \\nHeaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled \\nAffrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep \\nHer dark foundations, and too fast had bound', ' \\nNine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared, \\nAnd felt tenfold confusion in their fall \\nThrough his wild anarchy, so huge a rout \\nIncumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last \\nYawning received them whole, and on them closed; \\nHell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire \\nUnquenchable, the house of woe and pain', ' \\nDisburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired \\nHer mural breach, returning whence it rolled', ' \\nSole victor, from the expulsion of his foes, \\nMessiah his triumphal chariot turned: \\nTo meet him all his Saints, who silent stood \\nEye-witnesses of his almighty acts, \\nWith jubilee advanced; and, as they went, \\nShaded with branching palm, each Order bright, \\nSung triumph, and him sung victorious King, \\nSon, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, \\nWorthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode \\nTriumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts \\nAnd temple of his Mighty Father throned \\nOn high; who into glory him received, \\nWhere now he sits at the right hand of bliss', ' \\nThus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth, \\nAt thy request, and that thou mayest beware \\nBy what is past, to thee I have revealed \\nWhat might have else to human race been hid; \\nThe discord which befel, and war in Heaven \\nAmong the angelick Powers, and the deep fall \\nOf those too high aspiring, who rebelled \\nWith Satan; he who envies now thy state, \\nWho now is plotting how he may seduce \\nThee also from obedience, that, with him \\nBereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake \\nHis punishment, eternal misery; \\nWhich would be all his solace and revenge, \\nAs a despite done against the Most High, \\nThee once to gain companion of his woe', ' \\nBut listen not to his temptations, warn \\nThy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, \\nBy terrible example, the reward \\nOf disobedience;

things, to their thought \\nSo unimaginable, as hate in Heaven, \\nAnd war so near the peace of God in bliss, \\nWith such confusion: but the evil, soon \\nDriven back, redounded as a flood on those \\nFrom whom it sprung; impossible to mix \\nWith blessedness', '  Whence Adam soon repealed \\nThe doubts that in his heart arose: and now \\nLed on, yet sinless, with desire to know \\nWhat nearer might concern him, how this world \\nOf Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began; \\nWhen, and whereof created; for what cause; \\nWhat within Eden, or without, was done \\nBefore his memory; as one whose drouth \\nYet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, \\nWhose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, \\nProceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest', ' \\nGreat things, and full of wonder in our ears, \\nFar differing from this world, thou hast revealed, \\nDivine interpreter', ' by favour sent \\nDown from the empyrean, to forewarn \\nUs timely of what might else have been our loss, \\nUnknown, which human knowledge could not reach;

she in a cloudy tabernacle \\nSojourned the while', '  God saw the light was good; \\nAnd light from darkness by the hemisphere \\nDivided: light the Day, and darkness Night, \\nHe named', '  Thus was the first day even and morn: \\nNor past uncelebrated, nor unsung \\nBy the celestial quires, when orient light \\nExhaling first from darkness they beheld;

and the great receptacle \\nOf congregated waters, he called Seas: \\nAnd saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth \\nPut forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, \\nAnd fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, \\nWhose seed is in herself upon the Earth', ' \\nHe scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then \\nDesart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, \\nBrought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad \\nHer universal face with pleasant green;

\\nWith tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; \\nWith borders long the rivers: that Earth now \\nSeemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, \\nOr wander with delight, and love to haunt \\nHer sacred shades: though God had yet not rained \\nUpon the Earth, and man to till the ground \\nNone was;

so steers the prudent crane \\nHer annual voyage, borne on winds; the air \\nFloats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes: \\nFrom branch to branch the smaller birds with song \\nSolaced the woods, and spread their painted wings \\nTill even; nor then the solemn nightingale \\nCeased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays: \\nOthers, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed \\nTheir downy breast; the swan with arched neck, \\nBetween her white wings mantling proudly, rows \\nHer state with oary feet; yet oft they quit \\nThe dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower \\nThe mid aereal sky:  Others on ground \\nWalked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds \\nThe silent hours, and the other whose gay train \\nAdorns him, coloured with the florid hue \\nOf rainbows and starry eyes\", '  The waters thus \\nWith fish replenished, and the air with fowl, \\nEvening and morn solemnized the fifth day', ' \\nThe sixth, and of creation last, arose \\nWith evening harps and matin;

\\nSpeed, to describe whose swiftness number fails', ' \\nSo spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed \\nEntering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve \\nPerceiving, where she sat retired in sight, \\nWith lowliness majestick from her seat, \\nAnd grace that won who saw to wish her stay, \\nRose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers, \\nTo visit how they prospered, bud and bloom, \\nHer nursery; they at her coming sprung, \\nAnd, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew', ' \\nYet went she not, as not with such discourse \\nDelighted, or not capable her ear \\nOf what was high: such pleasure she reserved, \\nAdam relating, she sole auditress; \\nHer husband the relater she preferred \\nBefore the Angel, and of him to ask \\nChose rather; he, she knew, would intermix \\nGrateful digressions, and solve high dispute \\nWith conjugal caresses: from his lip \\nNot words alone pleased her', '  O', ' when meet now \\nSuch pairs, in love and mutual honour joined', ' \\nWith Goddess-like demeanour forth she went, \\nNot unattended; for on her, as Queen, \\nA pomp of winning Graces waited still, \\nAnd from about her shot darts of desire \\nInto all eyes, to wish her still in sight', \" \\nAnd Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed, \\nBenevolent and facile thus replied\", \" \\nTo ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven \\nIs as the book of God before thee set, \\nWherein to read his wonderous works, and learn \\nHis seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years: \\nThis to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth, \\nImports not, if thou reckon right; the rest \\nFrom Man or Angel the great Architect \\nDid wisely to conceal, and not divulge \\nHis secrets to be scanned by them who ought \\nRather admire; or, if they list to try \\nConjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens \\nHath left to their disputes, perhaps to move \\nHis laughter at their quaint opinions wide \\nHereafter; when they come to model Heaven \\nAnd calculate the stars, how they will wield \\nThe mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive \\nTo save appearances; how gird the sphere \\nWith centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er, \\nCycle and epicycle, orb in orb: \\nAlready by thy reasoning this I guess, \\nWho art to lead thy offspring, and supposest \\nThat bodies bright and greater should not serve \\nThe less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run, \\nEarth sitting still, when she alone receives \\nThe benefit:  Consider first, that great \\nOr bright infers not excellence: the Earth \\nThough, in comparison of Heaven, so small, \\nNor glistering, may of solid good contain \\nMore plenty than the sun that barren shines; \\nWhose virtue on itself works no effect, \\nBut in the fruitful Earth; there first received, \\nHis beams, unactive else, their vigour find\", \" \\nYet not to Earth are those bright luminaries \\nOfficious; but to thee, Earth's habitant\", \" \\nAnd for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak \\nThe Maker's high magnificence, who built \\nSo spacious, and his line stretched out so far; \\nThat Man may know he dwells not in his own; \\nAn edifice too large for him to fill, \\nLodged in a small partition; and the rest \\nOrdained for uses to his Lord best known\", ' \\nThe swiftness of those circles attribute, \\nThough numberless, to his Omnipotence, \\nThat to corporeal substances could add \\nSpeed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow, \\nWho since the morning-hour set out from Heaven \\nWhere God resides, and ere mid-day arrived \\nIn Eden; distance inexpressible \\nBy numbers that have name', '  But this I urge, \\nAdmitting motion in the Heavens, to show \\nInvalid that which thee to doubt it moved; \\nNot that I so affirm, though so it seem \\nTo thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth', ' \\nGod, to remove his ways from human sense, \\nPlaced Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight, \\nIf it presume, might err in things too high, \\nAnd no advantage gain', '  What if the sun \\nBe center to the world; and other stars, \\nBy his attractive virtue and their own \\nIncited, dance about him various rounds', ' \\nTheir wandering course now high, now low, then hid, \\nProgressive, retrograde, or standing still, \\nIn six thou seest;

\\nSollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid; \\nLeave them to God above; him serve, and fear', ' \\nOf other creatures, as him pleases best, \\nWherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou \\nIn what he gives to thee, this Paradise \\nAnd thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high \\nTo know what passes there; be lowly wise: \\nThink only what concerns thee, and thy being; \\nDream not of other worlds, what creatures there \\nLive, in what state, condition, or degree; \\nContented that thus far hath been revealed \\nNot of Earth only, but of highest Heaven', ' \\nTo whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied', ' \\nHow fully hast thou satisfied me, pure \\nIntelligence of Heaven, Angel serene', ' \\nAnd, freed from intricacies, taught to live \\nThe easiest way;

\\nTill warned, or by experience taught, she learn, \\nThat, not to know at large of things remote \\nFrom use, obscure and subtle; but, to know \\nThat which before us lies in daily life, \\nIs the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume, \\nOr emptiness, or fond impertinence: \\nAnd renders us, in things that most concern, \\nUnpractised, unprepared, and still to seek', ' \\nTherefore from this high pitch let us descend \\nA lower flight, and speak of things at hand \\nUseful; whence, haply, mention may arise \\nOf something not unseasonable to ask, \\nBy sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned', ' \\nThee I have heard relating what was done \\nEre my remembrance: now, hear me relate \\nMy story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;

for I attend, \\nPleased with thy words no less than thou with mine', ' \\nSo spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire', ' \\nFor Man to tell how human life began \\nIs hard; for who himself beginning knew \\nDesire with thee still longer to converse \\nInduced me', '  As new waked from soundest sleep, \\nSoft on the flowery herb I found me laid, \\nIn balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun \\nSoon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed', \" \\nStraight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, \\nAnd gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised \\nBy quick instinctive motion, up I sprung, \\nAs thitherward endeavouring, and upright \\nStood on my feet: about me round I saw \\nHill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains, \\nAnd liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, \\nCreatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew; \\nBirds on the branches warbling; all things smiled; \\nWith fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed\", \" \\nMyself I then perused, and limb by limb \\nSurveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran \\nWith supple joints, as lively vigour led: \\nBut who I was, or where, or from what cause, \\nKnew not;

when, answer none returned, \\nOn a green shady bank, profuse of flowers, \\nPensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep \\nFirst found me, and with soft oppression seised \\nMy droused sense, untroubled, though I thought \\nI then was passing to my former state \\nInsensible, and forthwith to dissolve: \\nWhen suddenly stood at my head a dream, \\nWhose inward apparition gently moved \\nMy fancy to believe I yet had being, \\nAnd lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine, \\nAnd said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise, \\n'First Man, of men innumerable ordained \\n'First Father\", \" called by thee, I come thy guide \\n'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared\", \"' \\nSo saying, by the hand he took me raised, \\nAnd over fields and waters, as in air \\nSmooth-sliding without step, last led me up \\nA woody mountain; whose high top was plain, \\nA circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees \\nPlanted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw \\nOf Earth before scarce pleasant seemed\", '  Each tree, \\nLoaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye \\nTempting, stirred in me sudden appetite \\nTo pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found \\nBefore mine eyes all real, as the dream \\nHad lively shadowed:  Here had new begun \\nMy wandering, had not he, who was my guide \\nUp hither, from among the trees appeared, \\nPresence Divine', \"  Rejoicing, but with awe, \\nIn adoration at his feet I fell \\nSubmiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,' \\nSaid mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest \\n'Above, or round about thee, or beneath\", \" \\n'This Paradise I give thee, count it thine \\n'To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat: \\n'Of every tree that in the garden grows \\n'Eat freely with glad heart;

these cowering low \\nWith blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing\", ' \\nI named them, as they passed, and understood \\nTheir nature, with such knowledge God endued \\nMy sudden apprehension:  But in these \\nI found not what methought I wanted still; \\nAnd to the heavenly Vision thus presumed', ' \\nO, by what name, for thou above all these, \\nAbove mankind, or aught than mankind higher, \\nSurpassest far my naming; how may I \\nAdore thee, Author of this universe, \\nAnd all this good to man', ' for whose well being \\nSo amply, and with hands so liberal, \\nThou hast provided all things:  But with me \\nI see not who partakes', '  In solitude \\nWhat happiness, who can enjoy alone, \\nOr, all enjoying, what contentment find', ' \\nThus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright, \\nAs with a smile more brightened, thus replied', ' \\nWhat callest thou solitude', '  Is not the Earth \\nWith various living creatures, and the air \\nReplenished, and all these at thy command \\nTo come and play before thee', '  Knowest thou not \\nTheir language and their ways', '  They also know, \\nAnd reason not contemptibly:  With these \\nFind pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large', ' \\nSo spake the Universal Lord, and seemed \\nSo ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored, \\nAnd humble deprecation, thus replied', ' \\nLet not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power; \\nMy Maker, be propitious while I speak', ' \\nHast thou not made me here thy substitute, \\nAnd these inferiour far beneath me set', ' \\nAmong unequals what society \\nCan sort, what harmony, or true delight', ' \\nWhich must be mutual, in proportion due \\nGiven and received; but, in disparity \\nThe one intense, the other still remiss, \\nCannot well suit with either, but soon prove \\nTedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak \\nSuch as I seek, fit to participate \\nAll rational delight: wherein the brute \\nCannot be human consort:  They rejoice \\nEach with their kind, lion with lioness; \\nSo fitly them in pairs thou hast combined: \\nMuch less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl \\nSo well converse, nor with the ox the ape; \\nWorse then can man with beast, and least of all', ' \\nWhereto the Almighty answered, not displeased', ' \\nA nice and subtle happiness, I see, \\nThou to thyself proposest, in the choice \\nOf thy associates, Adam', ' and wilt taste \\nNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary', ' \\nWhat thinkest thou then of me, and this my state', ' \\nSeem I to thee sufficiently possessed \\nOf happiness, or not', ' who am alone \\nFrom all eternity; for none I know \\nSecond to me or like, equal much less', ' \\nHow have I then with whom to hold converse, \\nSave with the creatures which I made, and those \\nTo me inferiour, infinite descents \\nBeneath what other creatures are to thee', ' \\nHe ceased; I lowly answered', '  To attain \\nThe highth and depth of thy eternal ways \\nAll human thoughts come short, Supreme of things', ' \\nThou in thyself art perfect, and in thee \\nIs no deficience found:  Not so is Man, \\nBut in degree; the cause of his desire \\nBy conversation with his like to help \\nOr solace his defects', '  No need that thou \\nShouldst propagate, already Infinite; \\nAnd through all numbers absolute, though One: \\nBut Man by number is to manifest \\nHis single imperfection, and beget \\nLike of his like, his image multiplied, \\nIn unity defective; which requires \\nCollateral love, and dearest amity', ' \\nThou in thy secresy although alone, \\nBest with thyself accompanied, seekest not \\nSocial communication; yet, so pleased, \\nCanst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt \\nOf union or communion, deified: \\nI, by conversing, cannot these erect \\nFrom prone; nor in their ways complacence find', ' \\nThus I emboldened spake, and freedom used \\nPermissive, and acceptance found; which gained \\nThis answer from the gracious Voice Divine', \" \\nThus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;

for now \\nMy earthly by his heavenly overpowered, \\nWhich it had long stood under, strained to the highth \\nIn that celestial colloquy sublime, \\nAs with an object that excels the sense \\nDazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair \\nOf sleep, which instantly fell on me, called \\nBy Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes', ' \\nMine eyes he closed, but open left the cell \\nOf fancy, my internal sight; by which, \\nAbstract as in a trance, methought I saw, \\nThough sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape \\nStill glorious before whom awake I stood: \\nWho stooping opened my left side, and took \\nFrom thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm, \\nAnd life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, \\nBut suddenly with flesh filled up and healed: \\nThe rib he formed and fashioned with his hands; \\nUnder his forming hands a creature grew, \\nMan-like, but different sex; so lovely fair, \\nThat what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now \\nMean, or in her summed up, in her contained \\nAnd in her looks; which from that time infused \\nSweetness into my heart, unfelt before, \\nAnd into all things from her air inspired \\nThe spirit of love and amorous delight', ' \\nShe disappeared, and left me dark; I waked \\nTo find her, or for ever to deplore \\nHer loss, and other pleasures all abjure: \\nWhen out of hope, behold her, not far off, \\nSuch as I saw her in my dream, adorned \\nWith what all Earth or Heaven could bestow \\nTo make her amiable:  On she came, \\nLed by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, \\nAnd guided by his voice; nor uninformed \\nOf nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites: \\nGrace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, \\nIn every gesture dignity and love', ' \\nI, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud', ' \\nThis turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled \\nThy words, Creator bounteous and benign, \\nGiver of all things fair', ' but fairest this \\nOf all thy gifts', ' nor enviest', '  I now see \\nBone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself \\nBefore me:  Woman is her name;of Man \\nExtracted: for this cause he shall forego \\nFather and mother, and to his wife adhere; \\nAnd they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul', ' \\nShe heard me thus; and though divinely brought, \\nYet innocence, and virgin modesty, \\nHer virtue, and the conscience of her worth, \\nThat would be wooed, and not unsought be won, \\nNot obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired, \\nThe more desirable; or, to say all, \\nNature herself, though pure of sinful thought, \\nWrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned: \\nI followed her; she what was honour knew, \\nAnd with obsequious majesty approved \\nMy pleaded reason', '  To the nuptial bower \\nI led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven, \\nAnd happy constellations, on that hour \\nShed their selectest influence; the Earth \\nGave sign of gratulation, and each hill; \\nJoyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs \\nWhispered it to the woods, and from their wings \\nFlung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub, \\nDisporting, till the amorous bird of night \\nSung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star \\nOn his hill top, to light the bridal lamp', ' \\nThus have I told thee all my state, and brought \\nMy story to the sum of earthly bliss, \\nWhich I enjoy; and must confess to find \\nIn all things else delight indeed, but such \\nAs, used or not, works in the mind no change, \\nNor vehement desire; these delicacies \\nI mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers, \\nWalks, and the melody of birds: but here \\nFar otherwise, transported I behold, \\nTransported touch; here passion first I felt, \\nCommotion strange', \" in all enjoyments else \\nSuperiour and unmoved; here only weak \\nAgainst the charm of Beauty's powerful glance\", ' \\nOr Nature failed in me, and left some part \\nNot proof enough such object to sustain; \\nOr, from my side subducting, took perhaps \\nMore than enough; at least on her bestowed \\nToo much of ornament, in outward show \\nElaborate, of inward less exact', \" \\nFor well I understand in the prime end \\nOf Nature her the inferiour, in the mind \\nAnd inward faculties, which most excel;

 Wisdom in discourse with her \\nLoses discountenanced, and like Folly shows; \\nAuthority and Reason on her wait, \\nAs one intended first, not after made \\nOccasionally; and, to consummate all, \\nGreatness of mind and Nobleness their seat \\nBuild in her loveliest, and create an awe \\nAbout her, as a guard angelick placed\", ' \\nTo whom the Angel with contracted brow', ' \\nAccuse not Nature, she hath done her part; \\nDo thou but thine; and be not diffident \\nOf Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou \\nDismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh, \\nBy attributing overmuch to things \\nLess excellent, as thou thyself perceivest', ' \\nFor, what admirest thou, what transports thee so, \\nAn outside', ' fair, no doubt, and worthy well \\nThy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;

how is it now become \\nSo dreadful to thee', '  That thou art naked, who \\nHath told thee', '  Hast thou eaten of the tree, \\nWhereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat', ' \\nTo whom thus Adam sore beset replied', ' \\nO Heaven', ' in evil strait this day I stand \\nBefore my Judge; either to undergo \\nMyself the total crime, or to accuse \\nMy other self, the partner of my life; \\nWhose failing, while her faith to me remains, \\nI should conceal, and not expose to blame \\nBy my complaint: but strict necessity \\nSubdues me, and calamitous constraint; \\nLest on my head both sin and punishment, \\nHowever insupportable, be all \\nDevolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou \\nWouldst easily detect what I conceal', '-- \\nThis Woman, whom thou madest to be my help, \\nAnd gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good, \\nSo fit, so acceptable, so divine, \\nThat from her hand I could suspect no ill, \\nAnd what she did, whatever in itself, \\nHer doing seemed to justify the deed; \\nShe gave me of the tree, and I did eat', ' \\nTo whom the Sovran Presence thus replied', ' \\nWas she thy God, that her thou didst obey \\nBefore his voice', ' or was she made thy guide, \\nSuperiour, or but equal, that to her \\nThou didst resign thy manhood, and the place \\nWherein God set thee above her made of thee, \\nAnd for thee, whose perfection far excelled \\nHers in all real dignity', '  Adorned \\nShe was indeed, and lovely, to attract \\nThy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts \\nWere such, as under government well seemed; \\nUnseemly to bear rule; which was thy part \\nAnd person, hadst thou known thyself aright', ' \\nSo having said, he thus to Eve in few', ' \\nSay, Woman, what is this which thou hast done', ' \\nTo whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, \\nConfessing soon, yet not before her Judge \\nBold or loquacious, thus abashed replied', ' \\nThe Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat', ' \\nWhich when the Lord God heard, without delay \\nTo judgement he proceeded on the accused \\nSerpent, though brute; unable to transfer \\nThe guilt on him, who made him instrument \\nOf mischief, and polluted from the end \\nOf his creation; justly then accursed, \\nAs vitiated in nature:  More to know \\nConcerned not Man, (since he no further knew) \\nNor altered his offence; yet God at last \\nTo Satan first in sin his doom applied, \\nThough in mysterious terms, judged as then best: \\nAnd on the Serpent thus his curse let fall', ' \\nBecause thou hast done this, thou art accursed \\nAbove all cattle, each beast of the field; \\nUpon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, \\nAnd dust shalt eat all the days of thy life', ' \\nBetween thee and the woman I will put \\nEnmity, and between thine and her seed; \\nHer seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel', ' \\nSo spake this oracle, then verified \\nWhen Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve, \\nSaw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven, \\nPrince of the air; then, rising from his grave \\nSpoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed \\nIn open show; and, with ascension bright, \\nCaptivity led captive through the air, \\nThe realm itself of Satan, long usurped; \\nWhom he shall tread at last under our feet; \\nEven he, who now foretold his fatal bruise; \\nAnd to the Woman thus his sentence turned', \" \\nThy sorrow I will greatly multiply \\nBy thy conception; children thou shalt bring \\nIn sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will \\nThine shall submit; he over thee shall rule\", ' \\nOn Adam last thus judgement he pronounced', ' \\nBecause thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, \\nAnd eaten of the tree, concerning which \\nI charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof: \\nCursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow \\nShalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life; \\nThorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth \\nUnbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; \\nIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, \\nTill thou return unto the ground; for thou \\nOut of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, \\nFor dust thou art, and shalt to dust return', ' \\nSo judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent; \\nAnd the instant stroke of death, denounced that day, \\nRemoved far off; then, pitying how they stood \\nBefore him naked to the air, that now \\nMust suffer change, disdained not to begin \\nThenceforth the form of servant to assume; \\nAs when he washed his servants feet; so now, \\nAs father of his family, he clad \\nTheir nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, \\nOr as the snake with youthful coat repaid; \\nAnd thought not much to clothe his enemies; \\nNor he their outward only with the skins \\nOf beasts, but inward nakedness, much more', \" \\nOpprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, \\nArraying, covered from his Father's sight\", ' \\nTo him with swift ascent he up returned, \\nInto his blissful bosom reassumed \\nIn glory, as of old; to him appeased \\nAll, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man \\nRecounted, mixing intercession sweet', ' \\nMean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, \\nWithin the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, \\nIn counterview within the gates, that now \\nStood open wide, belching outrageous flame \\nFar into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through, \\nSin opening; who thus now to Death began', ' \\nO Son, why sit we here each other viewing \\nIdly, while Satan, our great author, thrives \\nIn other worlds, and happier seat provides \\nFor us, his offspring dear', '  It cannot be \\nBut that success attends him; if mishap, \\nEre this he had returned, with fury driven \\nBy his avengers; since no place like this \\nCan fit his punishment, or their revenge', ' \\nMethinks I feel new strength within me rise, \\nWings growing, and dominion given me large \\nBeyond this deep; whatever draws me on, \\nOr sympathy, or some connatural force, \\nPowerful at greatest distance to unite, \\nWith secret amity, things of like kind, \\nBy secretest conveyance', '  Thou, my shade \\nInseparable, must with me along; \\nFor Death from Sin no power can separate', ' \\nBut, lest the difficulty of passing back \\nStay his return perhaps over this gulf \\nImpassable, impervious; let us try \\nAdventurous work, yet to thy power and mine \\nNot unagreeable, to found a path \\nOver this main from Hell to that new world, \\nWhere Satan now prevails; a monument \\nOf merit high to all the infernal host, \\nEasing their passage hence, for intercourse, \\nOr transmigration, as their lot shall lead', ' \\nNor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn \\nBy this new-felt attraction and instinct', ' \\nWhom thus the meager Shadow answered soon', ' \\nGo, whither Fate, and inclination strong, \\nLeads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err \\nThe way, thou leading; such a scent I draw \\nOf carnage, prey innumerable, and taste \\nThe savour of death from all things there that live: \\nNor shall I to the work thou enterprisest \\nBe wanting, but afford thee equal aid', ' \\nSo saying, with delight he snuffed the smell \\nOf mortal change on earth', '  As when a flock \\nOf ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, \\nAgainst the day of battle, to a field, \\nWhere armies lie encamped, come flying, lured \\nWith scent of living carcasses designed \\nFor death, the following day, in bloody fight: \\nSo scented the grim Feature, and upturned \\nHis nostril wide into the murky air; \\nSagacious of his quarry from so far', ' \\nThen both from out Hell-gates, into the waste \\nWide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark, \\nFlew diverse; and with power (their power was great) \\nHovering upon the waters, what they met \\nSolid or slimy, as in raging sea \\nTost up and down, together crouded drove, \\nFrom each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell; \\nAs when two polar winds, blowing adverse \\nUpon the Cronian sea, together drive \\nMountains of ice, that stop the imagined way \\nBeyond Petsora eastward, to the rich \\nCathaian coast', '  The aggregated soil \\nDeath with his mace petrifick, cold and dry, \\nAs with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm \\nAs Delos, floating once; the rest his look \\nBound with Gorgonian rigour not to move; \\nAnd with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate, \\nDeep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach \\nThey fastened, and the mole immense wrought on \\nOver the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge \\nOf length prodigious, joining to the wall \\nImmoveable of this now fenceless world, \\nForfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, \\nSmooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell', ' \\nSo, if great things to small may be compared, \\nXerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, \\nFrom Susa, his Memnonian palace high, \\nCame to the sea: and, over Hellespont \\nBridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, \\nAnd scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves', ' \\nNow had they brought the work by wonderous art \\nPontifical, a ridge of pendant rock, \\nOver the vexed abyss, following the track \\nOf Satan to the self-same place where he \\nFirst lighted from his wing, and landed safe \\nFrom out of Chaos, to the outside bare \\nOf this round world:  With pins of adamant \\nAnd chains they made all fast, too fast they made \\nAnd durable', '  And now in little space \\nThe confines met of empyrean Heaven, \\nAnd of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell \\nWith long reach interposed; three several ways \\nIn sight, to each of these three places led', ' \\nAnd now their way to Earth they had descried, \\nTo Paradise first tending; when, behold', ' \\nSatan, in likeness of an Angel bright, \\nBetwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering \\nHis zenith, while the sun in Aries rose: \\nDisguised he came; but those his children dear \\nTheir parent soon discerned, though in disguise', ' \\nHe, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk \\nInto the wood fast by; and, changing shape, \\nTo observe the sequel, saw his guileful act \\nBy Eve, though all unweeting, seconded \\nUpon her husband; saw their shame that sought \\nVain covertures; but when he saw descend \\nThe Son of God to judge them, terrified \\nHe fled; not hoping to escape, but shun \\nThe present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath \\nMight suddenly inflict; that past, returned \\nBy night, and listening where the hapless pair \\nSat in their sad discourse, and various plaint, \\nThence gathered his own doom; which understood \\nNot instant, but of future time, with joy \\nAnd tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned; \\nAnd at the brink of Chaos, near the foot \\nOf this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped \\nMet, who to meet him came, his offspring dear', ' \\nGreat joy was at their meeting, and at sight \\nOf that stupendious bridge his joy encreased', ' \\nLong he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair \\nEnchanting daughter, thus the silence broke', ' \\nO Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, \\nThy trophies', ' which thou viewest as not thine own; \\nThou art their author, and prime architect: \\nFor I no sooner in my heart divined, \\nMy heart, which by a secret harmony \\nStill moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet, \\nThat thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks \\nNow also evidence, but straight I felt, \\nThough distant from thee worlds between, yet felt, \\nThat I must after thee, with this thy son;

thou us impowered \\nTo fortify thus far, and overlay, \\nWith this portentous bridge, the dark abyss', ' \\nThine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won \\nWhat thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained \\nWith odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged \\nOur foil in Heaven;

go, and be strong', ' \\nSo saying he dismissed them; they with speed \\nTheir course through thickest constellations held, \\nSpreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, \\nAnd planets, planet-struck, real eclipse \\nThen suffered', '  The other way Satan went down \\nThe causey to Hell-gate:  On either side \\nDisparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed, \\nAnd with rebounding surge the bars assailed, \\nThat scorned his indignation:  Through the gate, \\nWide open and unguarded, Satan passed, \\nAnd all about found desolate;

\\nHis arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining \\nEach other, till supplanted down he fell \\nA monstrous serpent on his belly prone, \\nReluctant, but in vain; a greater power \\nNow ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, \\nAccording to his doom: he would have spoke, \\nBut hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue \\nTo forked tongue; for now were all transformed \\nAlike, to serpents all, as accessories \\nTo his bold riot:  Dreadful was the din \\nOf hissing through the hall, thick swarming now \\nWith complicated monsters head and tail, \\nScorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, \\nCerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear, \\nAnd Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil \\nBedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle \\nOphiusa,) but still greatest he the midst, \\nNow Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun \\nIngendered in the Pythian vale or slime, \\nHuge Python, and his power no less he seemed \\nAbove the rest still to retain; they all \\nHim followed, issuing forth to the open field, \\nWhere all yet left of that revolted rout, \\nHeaven-fallen, in station stood or just array; \\nSublime with expectation when to see \\nIn triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief; \\nThey saw, but other sight instead', ' a croud \\nOf ugly serpents; horrour on them fell, \\nAnd horrid sympathy; for, what they saw, \\nThey felt themselves, now changing; down their arms, \\nDown fell both spear and shield; down they as fast; \\nAnd the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form \\nCatched, by contagion; like in punishment, \\nAs in their crime', '  Thus was the applause they meant, \\nTurned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame \\nCast on themselves from their own mouths', '  There stood \\nA grove hard by, sprung up with this their change, \\nHis will who reigns above, to aggravate \\nTheir penance, laden with fair fruit, like that \\nWhich grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve \\nUsed by the Tempter: on that prospect strange \\nTheir earnest eyes they fixed, imagining \\nFor one forbidden tree a multitude \\nNow risen, to work them further woe or shame; \\nYet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, \\nThough to delude them sent, could not abstain; \\nBut on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees \\nClimbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks \\nThat curled Megaera: greedily they plucked \\nThe fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew \\nNear that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed; \\nThis more delusive, not the touch, but taste \\nDeceived; they, fondly thinking to allay \\nTheir appetite with gust, instead of fruit \\nChewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste \\nWith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed, \\nHunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft, \\nWith hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws, \\nWith soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell \\nInto the same illusion, not as Man \\nWhom they triumphed once lapsed', '  Thus were they plagued \\nAnd worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss, \\nTill their lost shape, permitted, they resumed; \\nYearly enjoined, some say, to undergo, \\nThis annual humbling certain numbered days, \\nTo dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced', ' \\nHowever, some tradition they dispersed \\nAmong the Heathen, of their purchase got, \\nAnd fabled how the Serpent, whom they called \\nOphion, with Eurynome, the wide-- \\nEncroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule \\nOf high Olympus;

and far off his steps adore', ' \\nTo whom thus Michael with regard benign', ' \\nAdam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth; \\nNot this rock only; his Omnipresence fills \\nLand, sea, and air, and every kind that lives, \\nFomented by his virtual power and warmed: \\nAll the earth he gave thee to possess and rule, \\nNo despicable gift; surmise not then \\nHis presence to these narrow bounds confined \\nOf Paradise, or Eden: this had been \\nPerhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread \\nAll generations; and had hither come \\nFrom all the ends of the earth, to celebrate \\nAnd reverence thee, their great progenitor', ' \\nBut this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down \\nTo dwell on even ground now with thy sons: \\nYet doubt not but in valley, and in plain, \\nGod is, as here;

know, I am sent \\nTo show thee what shall come in future days \\nTo thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad \\nExpect to hear; supernal grace contending \\nWith sinfulness of men; thereby to learn \\nTrue patience, and to temper joy with fear \\nAnd pious sorrow; equally inured \\nBy moderation either state to bear, \\nProsperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead \\nSafest thy life, and best prepared endure \\nThy mortal passage when it comes', '--Ascend \\nThis hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes) \\nHere sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest; \\nAs once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed', ' \\nTo whom thus Adam gratefully replied', ' \\nAscend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path \\nThou leadest me;

and dwell \\nLong time in peace, by families and tribes, \\nUnder paternal rule: till one shall rise \\nOf proud ambitious heart; who, not content \\nWith fair equality, fraternal state, \\nWill arrogate dominion undeserved \\nOver his brethren, and quite dispossess \\nConcord and law of nature from the earth; \\nHunting (and men not beasts shall be his game) \\nWith war, and hostile snare, such as refuse \\nSubjection to his empire tyrannous: \\nA mighty hunter thence he shall be styled \\nBefore the Lord;

\\nAnd get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed \\nIn foreign lands, their memory be lost; \\nRegardless whether good or evil fame', ' \\nBut God, who oft descends to visit men \\nUnseen, and through their habitations walks \\nTo mark their doings, them beholding soon, \\nComes down to see their city, ere the tower \\nObstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets \\nUpon their tongues a various spirit, to rase \\nQuite out their native language; and, instead, \\nTo sow a jangling noise of words unknown: \\nForthwith a hideous gabble rises loud, \\nAmong the builders; each to other calls \\nNot understood; till hoarse, and all in rage, \\nAs mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven, \\nAnd looking down, to see the hubbub strange, \\nAnd hear the din:  Thus was the building left \\nRidiculous, and the work Confusion named', ' \\nWhereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased', ' \\nO execrable son', ' so to aspire \\nAbove his brethren; to himself assuming \\nAuthority usurped, from God not given: \\nHe gave us only over beast, fish, fowl, \\nDominion absolute; that right we hold \\nBy his donation; but man over men \\nHe made not lord; such title to himself \\nReserving, human left from human free', ' \\nBut this usurper his encroachment proud \\nStays not on Man; to God his tower intends \\nSiege and defiance:  Wretched man', 'what food \\nWill he convey up thither, to sustain \\nHimself and his rash army; where thin air \\nAbove the clouds will pine his entrails gross, \\nAnd famish him of breath, if not of bread', ' \\nTo whom thus Michael', '  Justly thou abhorrest \\nThat son, who on the quiet state of men \\nSuch trouble brought, affecting to subdue \\nRational liberty;

and to servitude reduce \\nMan, till then free', '  Therefore, since he permits \\nWithin himself unworthy powers to reign \\nOver free reason, God, in judgement just, \\nSubjects him from without to violent lords; \\nWho oft as undeservedly enthrall \\nHis outward freedom:  Tyranny must be; \\nThough to the tyrant thereby no excuse', ' \\nYet sometimes nations will decline so low \\nFrom virtue, which is reason, that no wrong, \\nBut justice, and some fatal curse annexed, \\nDeprives them of their outward liberty; \\nTheir inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son \\nOf him who built the ark; who, for the shame \\nDone to his father, heard this heavy curse, \\nServant of servants, on his vicious race', ' \\nThus will this latter, as the former world, \\nStill tend from bad to worse;

thunder mixed with hail, \\nHail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky, \\nAnd wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls; \\nWhat it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain, \\nA darksome cloud of locusts swarming down \\nMust eat, and on the ground leave nothing green; \\nDarkness must overshadow all his bounds, \\nPalpable darkness, and blot out three days; \\nLast, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born \\nOf Egypt must lie dead', '  Thus with ten wounds \\nThe river-dragon tamed at length submits \\nTo let his sojourners depart, and oft \\nHumbles his stubborn heart;
