      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit \n",
      "Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste \n",
      "Brought death into the World, and all our woe, \n",
      "With loss of Eden, till one greater Man \n",
      "Restore us, and regain the blissful seat, \n",
      "Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top \n",
      "Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire \n",
      "That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed \n",
      "In the beginning how the heavens and earth \n",
      "Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill \n",
      "Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed \n",
      "Fast by the oracle of God, I thence \n",
      "Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song, \n",

      "Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues \n",
      "Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme. \n",

      "Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first \n",
      "Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, \n",
      "Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss, \n",
      "And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark \n",
      "Illumine, what is low raise and support; \n",
      "That, to the height of this great argument, \n",
      "I may assert Eternal Providence, \n",
      "And justify the ways of God to men. \n",
      "  Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, \n",
      "Nor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause \n",
      "Moved our grand parents, in that happy state, \n",
      "Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off \n",
      "From their Creator, and transgress his will \n",
      "For one restraint, lords of the World besides. \n",
      "Who first seduced them to that foul revolt? \n",
      "  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, \n",
      "Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived \n",
      "The mother of mankind, what time his pride \n",
      "Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host \n",
      "Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring \n",
      "To set himself in glory above his peers, \n",
      "He trusted to have equalled the Most High, \n",
      "If he opposed, and with ambitious aim \n",
      "Against the throne and monarchy of God, \n",
      "Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, \n",
      "With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power \n",
      "Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, \n",
      "With hideous ruin and combustion, down \n",
      "To bottomless perdition, there to dwell \n",
      "In adamantine chains and penal fire, \n",
      "Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms. \n",
      "  Nine times the space that measures day and night \n",
      "To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, \n",
      "Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, \n",
      "Confounded, though immortal. But his doom \n",
      "Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought \n",
      "Both of lost happiness and lasting pain \n",
      "Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, \n",
      "That witnessed huge affliction and dismay, \n",
      "Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. \n",
      "At once, as far as Angels ken, he views \n",
      "The dismal situation waste and wild. \n",
      "A dungeon horrible, on all sides round, \n",
      "As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames \n",
      "No light; but rather darkness visible \n",
      "Served only to discover sights of woe, \n",
      "Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace \n",
      "And rest can never dwell, hope never comes \n",
      "That comes to all, but torture without end \n",
      "Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed \n",
      "With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. \n",
      "Such place Eternal Justice has prepared \n",
      "For those rebellious; here their prison ordained \n",
      "In utter darkness, and their portion set, \n",
      "As far removed from God and light of Heaven \n",
      "As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole. \n",
      "Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell! \n",
      "There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed \n",
      "With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, \n",
      "He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side, \n",
      "One next himself in power, and next in crime, \n",
      "Long after known in Palestine, and named \n",
      "Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy, \n",
      "And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words \n",
      "Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- \n",
      "  \"If thou beest he--but O how fallen! how changed \n",
      "From him who, in the happy realms of light \n",
      "Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine \n",
      "Myriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league, \n",
      "United thoughts and counsels, equal hope \n",
      "And hazard in the glorious enterprise \n",
      "Joined with me once, now misery hath joined \n",
      "In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest \n",
      "From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved \n",
      "He with his thunder; and till then who knew \n",
      "The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those, \n",
      "Nor what the potent Victor in his rage \n",
      "Can else inflict, do I repent, or change, \n",
      "Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind, \n",
      "And high disdain from sense of injured merit, \n",
      "That with the Mightiest raised me to contend, \n",
      "And to the fierce contentions brought along \n",
      "Innumerable force of Spirits armed, \n",
      "That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, \n",
      "His utmost power with adverse power opposed \n",
      "In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, \n",
      "And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? \n",
      "All is not lost--the unconquerable will, \n",
      "And study of revenge, immortal hate, \n",
      "And courage never to submit or yield: \n",
      "And what is else not to be overcome? \n",
      "That glory never shall his wrath or might \n",
      "Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace \n",
      "With suppliant knee, and deify his power \n",
      "Who, from the terror of this arm, so late \n",
      "Doubted his empire--that were low indeed; \n",
      "That were an ignominy and shame beneath \n",
      "This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, \n",
      "And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; \n",
      "Since, through experience of this great event, \n",
      "In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced, \n",
      "We may with more successful hope resolve \n",
      "To wage by force or guile eternal war, \n",
      "Irreconcilable to our grand Foe, \n",
      "Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy \n",
      "Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.\" \n",
      "  So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain, \n",
      "Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair; \n",
      "And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:-- \n",
      "  \"O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers \n",
      "That led th' embattled Seraphim to war \n",
      "Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds \n",
      "Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King, \n",
      "And put to proof his high supremacy, \n",
      "Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, \n",
      "Too well I see and rue the dire event \n",
      "That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, \n",
      "Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host \n",
      "In horrible destruction laid thus low, \n",
      "As far as Gods and heavenly Essences \n",
      "Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains \n",
      "Invincible, and vigour soon returns, \n",
      "Though all our glory extinct, and happy state \n",
      "Here swallowed up in endless misery. \n",
      "But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now \n",
      "Of force believe almighty, since no less \n",
      "Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) \n",
      "Have left us this our spirit and strength entire, \n",
      "Strongly to suffer and support our pains, \n",
      "That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, \n",
      "Or do him mightier service as his thralls \n",
      "By right of war, whate'er his business be, \n",
      "Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire, \n",
      "Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep? \n",
      "What can it the avail though yet we feel \n",
      "Strength undiminished, or eternal being \n",
      "To undergo eternal punishment?\" \n",
      "  Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:-- \n",
      "\"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable, \n",
      "Doing or suffering: but of this be sure-- \n",
      "To do aught good never will be our task, \n",
      "But ever to do ill our sole delight, \n",
      "As being the contrary to his high will \n",
      "Whom we resist. If then his providence \n",
      "Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, \n",
      "Our labour must be to pervert that end, \n",
      "And out of good still to find means of evil; \n",
      "Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps \n",
      "Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb \n",
      "His inmost counsels from their destined aim. \n",
      "But see! the angry Victor hath recalled \n",
      "His ministers of vengeance and pursuit \n",
      "Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail, \n",
      "Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid \n",
      "The fiery surge that from the precipice \n",
      "Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, \n",
      "Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, \n",
      "Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now \n",
      "To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. \n",
      "Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn \n",
      "Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. \n",
      "Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, \n",
      "The seat of desolation, void of light, \n",

      "From off the tossing of these fiery waves; \n",
      "There rest, if any rest can harbour there; \n",

      "  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, \n",
      "With head uplift above the wave, and eyes \n",

      "With fixed anchor in his scaly rind, \n",
      "Moors by his side under the lee, while night \n",
      "Invests the sea, and wished morn delays. \n",

      "Brought her in naked beauty more adorned, \n",
      "More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods \n",
      "Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like \n",
      "In sad event, when to the unwiser son \n",
      "Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared \n",

      "These troublesome disguises which we wear, \n",
      "Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween, \n",
      "Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites \n",
      "Mysterious of connubial love refused: \n",
      "Whatever hypocrites austerely talk \n",
      "Of purity, and place, and innocence, \n",
      "Defaming as impure what God declares \n",
      "Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all. \n",

      "Relations dear, and all the charities \n",
      "Of father, son, and brother, first were known. \n",
      "Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, \n",

      "Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, \n",
      "Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball, \n",
      "Or serenate, which the starved lover sings \n",
      "To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. \n",
      "These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, \n",
      "And on their naked limbs the flowery roof \n",

      "Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek \n",
      "No happier state, and know to know no more. \n",
      "Now had night measured with her shadowy cone \n",
      "Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, \n",
      "And from their ivory port the Cherubim, \n",
      "Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed \n",
      "To their night watches in warlike parade; \n",
      "When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. \n",
      "Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south \n",
      "With strictest watch; these other wheel the north; \n",
      "Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part, \n",
      "Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. \n",
      "From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called \n",
      "That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge. \n",
      "Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed \n",
      "Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook; \n",
      "But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, \n",
      "Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm. \n",
      "This evening from the sun's decline arrived, \n",
      "Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen \n",
      "Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped \n",
      "The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: \n",
      "Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. \n",
      "So saying, on he led his radiant files, \n",
      "Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct \n",
      "In search of whom they sought:  Him there they found \n",
      "Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, \n",
      "Assaying by his devilish art to reach \n",
      "The organs of her fancy, and with them forge \n",
      "Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams; \n",
      "Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint \n",

      "Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure \n",
      "Touch of celestial temper, but returns \n",
      "Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts \n",
      "Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark \n",
      "Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid \n",
      "Fit for the tun some magazine to store \n",
      "Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain, \n",
      "With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air; \n",
      "So started up in his own shape the Fiend. \n",
      "Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed \n",
      "So sudden to behold the grisly king; \n",
      "Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon. \n",
      "Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell \n",
      "Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed, \n",
      "Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait, \n",
      "Here watching at the head of these that sleep? \n",
      "Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn, \n",
      "Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate \n",
      "For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar: \n",
      "Not to know me argues yourselves unknown, \n",
      "The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know, \n",
      "Why ask ye, and superfluous begin \n",
      "Your message, like to end as much in vain? \n",
      "To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. \n",
      "Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, \n",
      "Or undiminished brightness to be known, \n",
      "As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; \n",
      "That glory then, when thou no more wast good, \n",
      "Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now \n",
      "Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. \n",
      "But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account \n",
      "To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep \n",
      "This place inviolable, and these from harm. \n",
      "So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, \n",
      "Severe in youthful beauty, added grace \n",
      "Invincible:  Abashed the Devil stood, \n",
      "And felt how awful goodness is, and saw \n",
      "Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined \n",
      "His loss; but chiefly to find here observed \n",
      "His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed \n",
      "Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he, \n",
      "Best with the best, the sender, not the sent, \n",
      "Or all at once; more glory will be won, \n",
      "Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold, \n",
      "Will save us trial what the least can do \n",
      "Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. \n",
      "The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; \n",
      "But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, \n",
      "Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly \n",
      "He held it vain; awe from above had quelled \n",
      "His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh \n",
      "The western point, where those half-rounding guards \n",
      "Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, \n",
      "A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief, \n",
      "Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. \n",
      "O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet \n",
      "Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern \n",
      "Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; \n",
      "And with them comes a third of regal port, \n",
      "But faded splendour wan; who by his gait \n",
      "And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, \n",
      "Not likely to part hence without contest; \n",
      "Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. \n",
      "He scarce had ended, when those two approached, \n",
      "And brief related whom they brought, where found, \n",
      "How busied, in what form and posture couched. \n",
      "To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. \n",
      "Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed \n",
      "To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge \n",
      "Of others, who approve not to transgress \n",
      "By thy example, but have power and right \n",
      "To question thy bold entrance on this place; \n",
      "Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those \n",
      "Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! \n",
      "To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. \n",
      "Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, \n",
      "And such I held thee; but this question asked \n",
      "Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain! \n",
      "Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, \n",
      "Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt \n",
      "And boldly venture to whatever place \n",
      "Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change \n",

      "The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood \n",
      "Of golden panoply, refulgent host, \n",
      "Soon banded; others from the dawning hills \n",
      "Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour, \n",
      "Each quarter to descry the distant foe, \n",
      "Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight, \n",
      "In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met \n",
      "Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow \n",
      "But firm battalion; back with speediest sail \n",
      "Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, \n",
      "Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried. \n",
      "Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand, \n",
      "Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit \n",
      "This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud \n",
      "He comes, and settled in his face I see \n",
      "Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each \n",
      "His adamantine coat gird well, and each \n",
      "Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield, \n",
      "Borne even or high; for this day will pour down, \n",
      "If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, \n",
      "But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire. \n",
      "So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon \n",
      "In order, quit of all impediment; \n",
      "Instant without disturb they took alarm, \n",
      "And onward moved embattled:  When behold! \n",
      "Not distant far with heavy pace the foe \n",
      "Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube \n",
      "Training his devilish enginery, impaled \n",
      "On every side with shadowing squadrons deep, \n",
      "To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood \n",
      "A while; but suddenly at head appeared \n",
      "Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud. \n",
      "Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold; \n",
      "That all may see who hate us, how we seek \n",
      "Peace and composure, and with open breast \n",
      "Stand ready to receive them, if they like \n",
      "Our overture; and turn not back perverse: \n",
      "But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven! \n",
      "Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge \n",
      "Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand \n",

      "What we propound, and loud that all may hear! \n",
      "So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce \n",

      "Divided, and to either flank retired: \n",
      "Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange, \n",
      "A triple mounted row of pillars laid \n",
      "On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed, \n",
      "Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir, \n",
      "With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,) \n",

      "With hideous orifice gaped on us wide, \n",
      "Portending hollow truce:  At each behind \n",
      "A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed \n",
      "Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense, \n",
      "Collected stood within our thoughts amused, \n",
      "Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds \n",
      "Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied \n",
      "With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame, \n",
      "But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, \n",
      "From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar \n",
      "Embowelled with outrageous noise the air, \n",
      "And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul \n",
      "Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail \n",
      "Of iron globes; which, on the victor host \n",
      "Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote, \n",
      "That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand, \n",
      "Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell \n",
      "By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled; \n",
      "The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might \n",

      "By quick contraction or remove; but now \n",
      "Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout; \n",
      "Nor served it to relax their serried files. \n",
      "What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse \n",
      "Repeated, and indecent overthrow \n",
      "Doubled, would render them yet more despised, \n",
      "And to their foes a laughter; for in view \n",
      "Stood ranked of Seraphim another row, \n",
      "In posture to displode their second tire \n",
      "Of thunder:  Back defeated to return \n",
      "They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight, \n",

      "And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms \n",
      "Of composition, straight they changed their minds, \n",
      "Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, \n",
      "As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed \n",
      "Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps \n",
      "For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose, \n",
      "If our proposals once again were heard, \n",
      "We should compel them to a quick result. \n",
      "To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood. \n",
      "Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight, \n",
      "Of hard contents, and full of force urged home; \n",
      "Such as we might perceive amused them all, \n",
      "And stumbled many:  Who receives them right, \n",
      "Had need from head to foot well understand; \n",
      "Not understood, this gift they have besides, \n",
      "They show us when our foes walk not upright. \n",
      "So they among themselves in pleasant vein \n",

      "All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might \n",
      "To match with their inventions they presumed \n",
      "So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn, \n",
      "And all his host derided, while they stood \n",
      "A while in trouble:  But they stood not long; \n",
      "Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms \n",
      "Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. \n",
      "Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, \n",
      "Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!) \n",
      "Their arms away they threw, and to the hills \n",

      "Under the weight of mountains buried deep; \n",
      "Themselves invaded next, and on their heads \n",
      "Main promontories flung, which in the air \n",
      "Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed; \n",
      "Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised \n",
      "Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain \n",
      "Implacable, and many a dolorous groan; \n",
      "Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind \n",
      "Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, \n",
      "Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. \n",
      "The rest, in imitation, to like arms \n",
      "Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore: \n",
      "So hills amid the air encountered hills, \n",
      "Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire; \n",
      "That under ground they fought in dismal shade; \n",

      "Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure, \n",
      "Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen \n",
      "This tumult, and permitted all, advised: \n",
      "That his great purpose he might so fulfil, \n",
      "To honour his anointed Son avenged \n",
      "Upon his enemies, and to declare \n",
      "All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son, \n",
      "The Assessour of his throne, he thus began. \n",
      "Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, \n",
      "Son, in whose face invisible is beheld \n",
      "Visibly, what by Deity I am; \n",
      "And in whose hand what by decree I do, \n",
      "Second Omnipotence! two days are past, \n",
      "Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven, \n",
      "Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame \n",
      "These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight, \n",
      "As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed; \n",
      "For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest, \n",
      "Equal in their creation they were formed, \n",
      "Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought \n",
      "Insensibly, for I suspend their doom; \n",
      "Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last \n",
      "Endless, and no solution will be found: \n",
      "War wearied hath performed what war can do, \n",
      "And to disordered rage let loose the reins \n",
      "With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes \n",
      "Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main. \n",
      "Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; \n",
      "For thee I have ordained it; and thus far \n",
      "Have suffered, that the glory may be thine \n",
      "Of ending this great war, since none but Thou \n",

      "Immense I have transfused, that all may know \n",
      "In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare; \n",
      "And, this perverse commotion governed thus, \n",
      "To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir \n",
      "Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King \n",
      "By sacred unction, thy deserved right. \n",

      "To glorify thy Son, I always thee, \n",

      "Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled; \n",
      "To their prepared ill mansion driven down, \n",
      "To chains of darkness, and the undying worm; \n",
      "That from thy just obedience could revolt, \n",
      "Whom to obey is happiness entire. \n",
      "Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure \n",
      "Far separate, circling thy holy mount, \n",
      "Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, \n",
      "Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief. \n",
      "So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose \n",
      "From the right hand of Glory where he sat; \n",
      "And the third sacred morn began to shine, \n",
      "Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound \n",
      "The chariot of Paternal Deity, \n",
      "Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, \n",
      "Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed \n",
      "By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each \n",
      "Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all \n",
      "And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels \n",
      "Of beryl, and careering fires between; \n",
      "Over their heads a crystal firmament, \n",
      "Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure \n",
      "Amber, and colours of the showery arch. \n",
      "He, in celestial panoply all armed \n",
      "Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, \n",
      "Ascended; at his right hand Victory \n",
      "Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow \n",
      "And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; \n",
      "And from about him fierce effusion rolled \n",
      "Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: \n",
      "Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, \n",
      "He onward came; far off his coming shone; \n",
      "And twenty thousand (I their number heard) \n",
      "Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; \n",
      "He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime \n",
      "On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, \n",
      "Illustrious far and wide; but by his own \n",
      "First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, \n",
      "When the great ensign of Messiah blazed \n",
      "Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; \n",
      "Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced \n",
      "His army, circumfused on either wing, \n",
      "Under their Head imbodied all in one. \n",
      "Before him Power Divine his way prepared; \n",
      "At his command the uprooted hills retired \n",
      "Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went \n",
      "Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, \n",
      "And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. \n",
      "This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, \n",
      "And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, \n",
      "Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. \n",
      "In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? \n",
      "But to convince the proud what signs avail, \n",
      "Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? \n",
      "They, hardened more by what might most reclaim, \n",
      "Grieving to see his glory, at the sight \n",
      "Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth, \n",
      "Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud \n",
      "Weening to prosper, and at length prevail \n",
      "Against God and Messiah, or to fall \n",
      "In universal ruin last; and now \n",
      "To final battle drew, disdaining flight, \n",
      "Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God \n",
      "To all his host on either hand thus spake. \n",
      "Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, \n",
      "Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest: \n",
      "Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God \n",
      "Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause; \n",
      "And as ye have received, so have ye done, \n",
      "Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew \n",
      "The punishment to other hand belongs; \n",
      "Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: \n",
      "Number to this day's work is not ordained, \n",
      "Nor multitude; stand only, and behold \n",
      "God's indignation on these godless poured \n",
      "By me; not you, but me, they have despised, \n",
      "Yet envied; against me is all their rage, \n",
      "Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme \n",
      "Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains, \n",
      "Hath honoured me, according to his will. \n",
      "Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; \n",
      "That they may have their wish, to try with me \n",
      "In battle which the stronger proves; they all, \n",
      "Or I alone against them; since by strength \n",
      "They measure all, of other excellence \n",
      "Not emulous, nor care who them excels; \n",
      "Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. \n",
      "So spake the Son, and into terrour changed \n",
      "His countenance too severe to be beheld, \n",
      "And full of wrath bent on his enemies. \n",
      "At once the Four spread out their starry wings \n",
      "With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs \n",
      "Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound \n",
      "Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. \n",
      "He on his impious foes right onward drove, \n",
      "Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels \n",
      "The stedfast empyrean shook throughout, \n",
      "All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon \n",
      "Among them he arrived; in his right hand \n",
      "Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent \n",
      "Before him, such as in their souls infixed \n",
      "Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost, \n",
      "All courage; down their idle weapons dropt: \n",
      "O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode \n",
      "Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, \n",
      "That wished the mountains now might be again \n",
      "Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire. \n",
      "Nor less on either side tempestuous fell \n",
      "His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four \n",
      "Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels \n",
      "Distinct alike with multitude of eyes; \n",
      "One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye \n",
      "Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire \n",
      "Among the accursed, that withered all their strength, \n",
      "And of their wonted vigour left them drained, \n",
      "Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen. \n",
      "Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked \n",
      "His thunder in mid volley; for he meant \n",
      "Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven: \n",
      "The overthrown he raised, and as a herd \n",
      "Of goats or timorous flock together thronged \n",
      "Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued \n",
      "With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds \n",
      "And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, \n",
      "Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed \n",
      "Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight \n",
      "Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse \n",
      "Urged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw \n",
      "Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath \n",
      "Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. \n",
      "Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw \n",
      "Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled \n",
      "Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep \n",
      "Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. \n",
      "Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared, \n",
      "And felt tenfold confusion in their fall \n",
      "Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout \n",
      "Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last \n",
      "Yawning received them whole, and on them closed; \n",
      "Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire \n",
      "Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain. \n",
      "Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired \n",
      "Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled. \n",
      "Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes, \n",
      "Messiah his triumphal chariot turned: \n",
      "To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood \n",
      "Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts, \n",
      "With jubilee advanced; and, as they went, \n",
      "Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright, \n",
      "Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King, \n",
      "Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, \n",

      "What might have else to human race been hid; \n",
      "The discord which befel, and war in Heaven \n",
      "Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall \n",

      "Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun \n",
      "Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle \n",

      "Immediately the mountains huge appear \n",
      "Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave \n",
      "Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky: \n",
      "So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low \n",

      "Wave rolling after wave, where way they found, \n",
      "If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, \n",
      "Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; \n",
      "But they, or under ground, or circuit wide \n",
      "With serpent errour wandering, found their way, \n",
      "And on the washy oose deep channels wore; \n",
      "Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, \n",
      "All but within those banks, where rivers now \n",
      "Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train. \n",
      "The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle \n",
      "Of congregated waters, he called Seas: \n",
      "And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth \n",
      "Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, \n",
      "And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, \n",
      "Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth. \n",
      "He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then \n",
      "Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, \n",
      "Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad \n",
      "Her universal face with pleasant green; \n",
      "Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered \n",
      "Opening their various colours, and made gay \n",
      "Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown, \n",
      "Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept \n",
      "The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed \n",
      "Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub, \n",
      "And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last \n",
      "Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread \n",
      "Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed \n",
      "Their blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned; \n",
      "With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; \n",
      "With borders long the rivers: that Earth now \n",
      "Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, \n",
      "Or wander with delight, and love to haunt \n",
      "Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained \n",
      "Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground \n",
      "None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist \n",
      "Went up, and watered all the ground, and each \n",
      "Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth, \n",
      "God made, and every herb, before it grew \n",
      "On the green stem:  God saw that it was good: \n",
      "So even and morn recorded the third day. \n",
      "Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights \n",
      "High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide \n",
      "The day from night; and let them be for signs, \n",
      "For seasons, and for days, and circling years; \n",
      "And let them be for lights, as I ordain \n",
      "Their office in the firmament of Heaven, \n",
      "To give light on the Earth; and it was so. \n",
      "And God made two great lights, great for their use \n",
      "To Man, the greater to have rule by day, \n",
      "The less by night, altern; and made the stars, \n",
      "And set them in the firmament of Heaven \n",
      "To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day \n",
      "In their vicissitude, and rule the night, \n",
      "And light from darkness to divide.  God saw, \n",
      "Surveying his great work, that it was good: \n",
      "For of celestial bodies first the sun \n",
      "A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first, \n",
      "Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon \n",
      "Globose, and every magnitude of stars, \n",
      "And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field: \n",
      "Of light by far the greater part he took, \n",
      "Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed \n",
      "In the sun's orb, made porous to receive \n",
      "And drink the liquid light; firm to retain \n",
      "Her gathered beams, great palace now of light. \n",
      "Hither, as to their fountain, other stars \n",

      "Their small peculiar, though from human sight \n",
      "So far remote, with diminution seen, \n",
      "First in his east the glorious lamp was seen, \n",
      "Regent of day, and all the horizon round \n",
      "Invested with bright rays, jocund to run \n",
      "His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray \n",
      "Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, \n",
      "Shedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon, \n",
      "But opposite in levelled west was set, \n",
      "His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light \n",
      "From him; for other light she needed none \n",
      "In that aspect, and still that distance keeps \n",
      "Till night; then in the east her turn she shines, \n",
      "Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign \n",
      "With thousand lesser lights dividual holds, \n",
      "With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared \n",
      "Spangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned \n",
      "With their bright luminaries that set and rose, \n",
      "Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. \n",
      "And God said, Let the waters generate \n",
      "Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul: \n",
      "And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings \n",
      "Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven. \n",

      "My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought \n",
      "I then was passing to my former state \n",
      "Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: \n",
      "When suddenly stood at my head a dream, \n",
      "Whose inward apparition gently moved \n",
      "My fancy to believe I yet had being, \n",
      "And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine, \n",

      "Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up \n",
      "A woody mountain; whose high top was plain, \n",
      "A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees \n",
      "Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw \n",
      "Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree, \n",
      "Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye \n",
      "Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite \n",
      "To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found \n",
      "Before mine eyes all real, as the dream \n",
      "Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun \n",
      "My wandering, had not he, who was my guide \n",
      "Up hither, from among the trees appeared, \n",
      "Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe, \n",
      "In adoration at his feet I fell \n",
      "Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,' \n",
      "Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest \n",

      "'From that day mortal; and this happy state \n",
      "'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world \n",

      "The rigid interdiction, which resounds \n",
      "Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice \n",
      "Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect \n",

      "Their nature, with such knowledge God endued \n",
      "My sudden apprehension:  But in these \n",

      "Or, all enjoying, what contentment find? \n",
      "Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright, \n",
      "As with a smile more brightened, thus replied. \n",
      "What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth \n",

      "And reason not contemptibly:  With these \n",
      "Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large. \n",
      "So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed \n",
      "So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored, \n",
      "And humble deprecation, thus replied. \n",
      "Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power; \n",

      "My earthly by his heavenly overpowered, \n",
      "Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth \n",
      "In that celestial colloquy sublime, \n",
      "As with an object that excels the sense \n",
      "Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair \n",

      "Of fancy, my internal sight; by which, \n",
      "Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw, \n",
      "Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape \n",
      "Still glorious before whom awake I stood: \n",
      "Who stooping opened my left side, and took \n",
      "From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm, \n",
      "And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, \n",
      "But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed: \n",
      "The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands; \n",
      "Under his forming hands a creature grew, \n",
      "Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair, \n",
      "That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now \n",
      "Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained \n",
      "And in her looks; which from that time infused \n",
      "Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, \n",
      "And into all things from her air inspired \n",
      "The spirit of love and amorous delight. \n",
      "She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked \n",
      "To find her, or for ever to deplore \n",
      "Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: \n",
      "When out of hope, behold her, not far off, \n",
      "Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned \n",
      "With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow \n",
      "To make her amiable:  On she came, \n",
      "Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, \n",
      "And guided by his voice; nor uninformed \n",
      "Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites: \n",
      "Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, \n",
      "In every gesture dignity and love. \n",
      "I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud. \n",

      "Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign, \n",
      "Giver of all things fair! but fairest this \n",

      "Yet innocence, and virgin modesty, \n",
      "Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth, \n",
      "That would be wooed, and not unsought be won, \n",
      "Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired, \n",
      "The more desirable; or, to say all, \n",
      "Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought, \n",
      "Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned: \n",
      "I followed her; she what was honour knew, \n",
      "And with obsequious majesty approved \n",
      "My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower \n",
      "I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven, \n",
      "And happy constellations, on that hour \n",
      "Shed their selectest influence; the Earth \n",
      "Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill; \n",
      "Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs \n",
      "Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings \n",
      "Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub, \n",
      "Disporting, till the amorous bird of night \n",

      "On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp. \n",
      "Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought \n",
      "My story to the sum of earthly bliss, \n",
      "Which I enjoy; and must confess to find \n",
      "In all things else delight indeed, but such \n",
      "As, used or not, works in the mind no change, \n",
      "Nor vehement desire; these delicacies \n",

      "What may this mean? language of man pronounced \n",
      "By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed? \n",
      "The first, at least, of these I thought denied \n",
      "To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day, \n",
      "Created mute to all articulate sound: \n",
      "The latter I demur; for in their looks \n",

      "Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve! \n",
      "Easy to me it is to tell thee all \n",
      "What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed: \n",
      "I was at first as other beasts that graze \n",
      "The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, \n",
      "As was my food; nor aught but food discerned \n",
      "Or sex, and apprehended nothing high: \n",
      "Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced \n",
      "A goodly tree far distant to behold \n",
      "Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed, \n",
      "Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze; \n",
      "When from the boughs a savoury odour blown, \n",
      "Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense \n",
      "Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats \n",
      "Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, \n",
      "Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. \n",
      "To satisfy the sharp desire I had \n",
      "Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved \n",
      "Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once, \n",
      "Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent \n",
      "Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. \n",
      "About the mossy trunk I wound me soon; \n",

      "Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree \n",
      "All other beasts that saw, with like desire \n",
      "Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. \n",

      "Wanted not long; though to this shape retained. \n",
      "Thenceforth to speculations high or deep \n",
      "I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind \n",
      "Considered all things visible in Heaven, \n",
      "Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good: \n",
      "But all that fair and good in thy divine \n",
      "Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray, \n",
      "United I beheld; no fair to thine \n",
      "Equivalent or second! which compelled \n",
      "Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come \n",

      "For many are the trees of God that grow \n",
      "In Paradise, and various, yet unknown \n",

      "Help to disburden Nature of her birth. \n",
      "To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad. \n",
      "Empress, the way is ready, and not long; \n",
      "Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, \n",
      "Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past \n",
      "Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept \n",
      "My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon \n",
      "Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled \n",
      "In tangles, and made intricate seem straight, \n",
      "To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy \n",

      "Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way \n",
      "To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool; \n",
      "There swallowed up and lost, from succour far. \n",
      "So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud \n",
      "Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree \n",
      "Of prohibition, root of all our woe; \n",
      "Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. \n",
      "Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither, \n",

      "He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon \n",
      "Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds \n",
      "Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound \n",
      "Of instruments, that made melodious chime, \n",
      "Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved \n",
      "Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, \n",
      "Instinct through all proportions, low and high, \n",
      "Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. \n",
      "In other part stood one who, at the forge \n",
      "Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass \n",
      "Had melted, (whether found where casual fire \n",
      "Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, \n",
      "Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot \n",
      "To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream \n",
      "From underground;) the liquid ore he drained \n",
      "Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed \n",
      "First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought \n",

      "But on the hither side, a different sort \n",
      "From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat, \n",
      "Down to the plain descended; by their guise \n",
      "Just men they seemed, and all their study bent \n",
      "To worship God aright, and know his works \n",
      "Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve \n",
      "Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain \n",
      "Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! \n",
      "A bevy of fair women, richly gay \n",
      "In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung \n",
      "Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: \n",
      "The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes \n",
      "Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net \n",
      "Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose; \n",
      "And now of love they treat, till the evening-star, \n",
      "Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat \n",
      "They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke \n",
      "Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked: \n",
      "With feast and musick all the tents resound. \n",
      "Such happy interview, and fair event \n",
      "Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, \n",

      "True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest; \n",

      "Of peaceful days portends, than those two past; \n",
      "Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse; \n",
      "Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends. \n",

      "By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet; \n",
      "Created, as thou art, to nobler end \n",
      "Holy and pure, conformity divine. \n",

      "Woman's domestick honour and chief praise; \n",
      "Bred only and completed to the taste \n",
      "Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, \n",

      "To these that sober race of men, whose lives \n",

      "Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame \n",
      "Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles \n",

      "Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread \n",
      "Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! \n",
      "But still I see the tenour of Man's woe \n",
      "Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. \n",
      "From Man's effeminate slackness it begins, \n",

      "By wisdom, and superiour gifts received. \n",
      "But now prepare thee for another scene. \n",

      "Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies \n",
      "With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field, \n",
      "Deserted:  Others to a city strong \n",

      "[\"[Paradise Lost by John Milton 1667] \\n \\n \\nBook I \\n \\n \\nOf Man's first disobedience, and the fruit \\nOf that forbidden tree whose mortal taste \\nBrought death into the World, and all our woe, \\nWith loss of Eden, till one greater Man \\nRestore us, and regain the blissful seat, \\nSing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top \\nOf Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire \\nThat shepherd who first taught the chosen seed \\nIn the beginning how the heavens and earth \\nRose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill \\nDelight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed \\nFast by the oracle of God, I thence \\nInvoke thy aid to my adventurous song, \\nThat with no middle flight intends to soar \\nAbove th' Aonian mount, while it pursues \\nThings unattempted yet in prose or rhyme\", \" \\nAnd chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer \\nBefore all temples th' upright heart and pure, \\nInstruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first \\nWast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, \\nDove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss, \\nAnd mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark \\nIllumine, what is low raise and support; \\nThat, to the height of this great argument, \\nI may assert Eternal Providence, \\nAnd justify the ways of God to men\", ' \\n  Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, \\nNor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause \\nMoved our grand parents, in that happy state, \\nFavoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off \\nFrom their Creator, and transgress his will \\nFor one restraint, lords of the World besides', ' \\nWho first seduced them to that foul revolt', \" \\n  Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, \\nStirred up with envy and revenge, deceived \\nThe mother of mankind, what time his pride \\nHad cast him out from Heaven, with all his host \\nOf rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring \\nTo set himself in glory above his peers, \\nHe trusted to have equalled the Most High, \\nIf he opposed, and with ambitious aim \\nAgainst the throne and monarchy of God, \\nRaised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, \\nWith vain attempt\", \" Him the Almighty Power \\nHurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, \\nWith hideous ruin and combustion, down \\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell \\nIn adamantine chains and penal fire, \\nWho durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms\", ' \\n  Nine times the space that measures day and night \\nTo mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, \\nLay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, \\nConfounded, though immortal', ' But his doom \\nReserved him to more wrath; for now the thought \\nBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain \\nTorments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, \\nThat witnessed huge affliction and dismay, \\nMixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate', ' \\nAt once, as far as Angels ken, he views \\nThe dismal situation waste and wild', ' \\nA dungeon horrible, on all sides round, \\nAs one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames \\nNo light; but rather darkness visible \\nServed only to discover sights of woe, \\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace \\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes \\nThat comes to all, but torture without end \\nStill urges, and a fiery deluge, fed \\nWith ever-burning sulphur unconsumed', \" \\nSuch place Eternal Justice has prepared \\nFor those rebellious; here their prison ordained \\nIn utter darkness, and their portion set, \\nAs far removed from God and light of Heaven \\nAs from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole\", ' \\nOh how unlike the place from whence they fell', \" \\nThere the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed \\nWith floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, \\nHe soon discerns; and, weltering by his side, \\nOne next himself in power, and next in crime, \\nLong after known in Palestine, and named \\nBeelzebub\", ' To whom th\\' Arch-Enemy, \\nAnd thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words \\nBreaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- \\n  \"If thou beest he--but O how fallen', ' how changed \\nFrom him who, in the happy realms of light \\nClothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine \\nMyriads, though bright', '--if he whom mutual league, \\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope \\nAnd hazard in the glorious enterprise \\nJoined with me once, now misery hath joined \\nIn equal ruin;

nor obvious hill, \\nNor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides \\nTheir perfect ranks; for high above the ground \\nTheir march was, and the passive air upbore \\nTheir nimble tread; as when the total kind \\nOf birds, in orderly array on wing, \\nCame summoned over Eden to receive \\nTheir names of thee; so over many a tract \\nOf Heaven they marched, and many a province wide, \\nTenfold the length of this terrene:  At last, \\nFar in the horizon to the north appeared \\nFrom skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched \\nIn battailous aspect, and nearer view \\nBristled with upright beams innumerable \\nOf rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields \\nVarious, with boastful argument portrayed, \\nThe banded Powers of Satan hasting on \\nWith furious expedition; for they weened \\nThat self-same day, by fight or by surprise, \\nTo win the mount of God, and on his throne \\nTo set the Envier of his state, the proud \\nAspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain \\nIn the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed \\nAt first, that Angel should with Angel war, \\nAnd in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet \\nSo oft in festivals of joy and love \\nUnanimous, as sons of one great Sire, \\nHymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout \\nOf battle now began, and rushing sound \\nOf onset ended soon each milder thought', ' \\nHigh in the midst, exalted as a God, \\nThe Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat, \\nIdol of majesty divine, enclosed \\nWith flaming Cherubim, and golden shields; \\nThen lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now \\n\"twixt host and host but narrow space was left, \\nA dreadful interval, and front to front \\nPresented stood in terrible array \\nOf hideous length:  Before the cloudy van, \\nOn the rough edge of battle ere it joined, \\nSatan, with vast and haughty strides advanced, \\nCame towering, armed in adamant and gold;

the tenth on bended knee \\nHis massy spear upstaid; as if on earth \\nWinds under ground, or waters forcing way, \\nSidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat, \\nHalf sunk with all his pines', '  Amazement seised \\nThe rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see \\nThus foiled their mightiest;

and had Earth been then, all Earth \\nHad to her center shook', '  What wonder', ' when \\nMillions of fierce encountering Angels fought \\nOn either side, the least of whom could wield \\nThese elements, and arm him with the force \\nOf all their regions:  How much more of power \\nArmy against army numberless to raise \\nDreadful combustion warring, and disturb, \\nThough not destroy, their happy native seat; \\nHad not the Eternal King Omnipotent, \\nFrom his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled \\nAnd limited their might; though numbered such \\nAs each divided legion might have seemed \\nA numerous host; in strength each armed hand \\nA legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed \\nEach warriour single as in chief, expert \\nWhen to advance, or stand, or turn the sway \\nOf battle, open when, and when to close \\nThe ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight, \\nNone of retreat, no unbecoming deed \\nThat argued fear;

with huge two-handed sway \\nBrandished aloft, the horrid edge came down \\nWide-wasting; such destruction to withstand \\nHe hasted, and opposed the rocky orb \\nOf tenfold adamant, his ample shield, \\nA vast circumference', '  At his approach \\nThe great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil \\nSurceased, and glad, as hoping here to end \\nIntestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued \\nOr captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown \\nAnd visage all inflamed first thus began', \" \\nAuthor of evil, unknown till thy revolt, \\nUnnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest \\nThese acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, \\nThough heaviest by just measure on thyself, \\nAnd thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed \\nHeaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought \\nMisery, uncreated till the crime \\nOf thy rebellion\", ' how hast thou instilled \\nThy malice into thousands, once upright \\nAnd faithful, now proved false', '  But think not here \\nTo trouble holy rest;

\\nAscend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels \\nThat shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war, \\nMy bow and thunder, my almighty arms \\nGird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; \\nPursue these sons of darkness, drive them out \\nFrom all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep: \\nThere let them learn, as likes them, to despise \\nGod, and Messiah his anointed King\", ' \\nHe said, and on his Son with rays direct \\nShone full; he all his Father full expressed \\nIneffably into his face received; \\nAnd thus the Filial Godhead answering spake', \" \\nO Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones, \\nFirst, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st \\nTo glorify thy Son, I always thee, \\nAs is most just:  This I my glory account, \\nMy exaltation, and my whole delight, \\nThat thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will \\nFulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss\", ' \\nScepter and power, thy giving, I assume, \\nAnd gladlier shall resign, when in the end \\nThou shalt be all in all, and I in thee \\nFor ever; and in me all whom thou lovest: \\nBut whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on \\nThy terrours, as I put thy mildness on, \\nImage of thee in all things; and shall soon, \\nArmed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled; \\nTo their prepared ill mansion driven down, \\nTo chains of darkness, and the undying worm; \\nThat from thy just obedience could revolt, \\nWhom to obey is happiness entire', ' \\nThen shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure \\nFar separate, circling thy holy mount, \\nUnfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, \\nHymns of high praise, and I among them Chief', \" \\nSo said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose \\nFrom the right hand of Glory where he sat; \\nAnd the third sacred morn began to shine, \\nDawning through Heaven\", '  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound \\nThe chariot of Paternal Deity, \\nFlashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, \\nItself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed \\nBy four Cherubick shapes; four faces each \\nHad wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all \\nAnd wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels \\nOf beryl, and careering fires between; \\nOver their heads a crystal firmament, \\nWhereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure \\nAmber, and colours of the showery arch', ' \\nHe, in celestial panoply all armed \\nOf radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, \\nAscended; at his right hand Victory \\nSat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow \\nAnd quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; \\nAnd from about him fierce effusion rolled \\nOf smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: \\nAttended with ten thousand thousand Saints, \\nHe onward came; far off his coming shone; \\nAnd twenty thousand (I their number heard) \\nChariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; \\nHe on the wings of Cherub rode sublime \\nOn the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, \\nIllustrious far and wide; but by his own \\nFirst seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised, \\nWhen the great ensign of Messiah blazed \\nAloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; \\nUnder whose conduct Michael soon reduced \\nHis army, circumfused on either wing, \\nUnder their Head imbodied all in one', ' \\nBefore him Power Divine his way prepared; \\nAt his command the uprooted hills retired \\nEach to his place; they heard his voice, and went \\nObsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, \\nAnd with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled', ' \\nThis saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, \\nAnd to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, \\nInsensate, hope conceiving from despair', ' \\nIn heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell', ' \\nBut to convince the proud what signs avail, \\nOr wonders move the obdurate to relent', ' \\nThey, hardened more by what might most reclaim, \\nGrieving to see his glory, at the sight \\nTook envy; and, aspiring to his highth, \\nStood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud \\nWeening to prosper, and at length prevail \\nAgainst God and Messiah, or to fall \\nIn universal ruin last; and now \\nTo final battle drew, disdaining flight, \\nOr faint retreat; when the great Son of God \\nTo all his host on either hand thus spake', \" \\nStand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, \\nYe Angels armed; this day from battle rest: \\nFaithful hath been your warfare, and of God \\nAccepted, fearless in his righteous cause; \\nAnd as ye have received, so have ye done, \\nInvincibly:  But of this cursed crew \\nThe punishment to other hand belongs; \\nVengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: \\nNumber to this day's work is not ordained, \\nNor multitude; stand only, and behold \\nGod's indignation on these godless poured \\nBy me; not you, but me, they have despised, \\nYet envied; against me is all their rage, \\nBecause the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme \\nKingdom, and power, and glory appertains, \\nHath honoured me, according to his will\", ' \\nTherefore to me their doom he hath assigned; \\nThat they may have their wish, to try with me \\nIn battle which the stronger proves; they all, \\nOr I alone against them; since by strength \\nThey measure all, of other excellence \\nNot emulous, nor care who them excels; \\nNor other strife with them do I vouchsafe', ' \\nSo spake the Son, and into terrour changed \\nHis countenance too severe to be beheld, \\nAnd full of wrath bent on his enemies', ' \\nAt once the Four spread out their starry wings \\nWith dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs \\nOf his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound \\nOf torrent floods, or of a numerous host', ' \\nHe on his impious foes right onward drove, \\nGloomy as night; under his burning wheels \\nThe stedfast empyrean shook throughout, \\nAll but the throne itself of God', \"  Full soon \\nAmong them he arrived; in his right hand \\nGrasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent \\nBefore him, such as in their souls infixed \\nPlagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost, \\nAll courage; down their idle weapons dropt: \\nO'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode \\nOf Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, \\nThat wished the mountains now might be again \\nThrown on them, as a shelter from his ire\", ' \\nNor less on either side tempestuous fell \\nHis arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four \\nDistinct with eyes, and from the living wheels \\nDistinct alike with multitude of eyes; \\nOne Spirit in them ruled; and every eye \\nGlared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire \\nAmong the accursed, that withered all their strength, \\nAnd of their wonted vigour left them drained, \\nExhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen', ' \\nYet half his strength he put not forth, but checked \\nHis thunder in mid volley; for he meant \\nNot to destroy, but root them out of Heaven: \\nThe overthrown he raised, and as a herd \\nOf goats or timorous flock together thronged \\nDrove them before him thunder-struck, pursued \\nWith terrours, and with furies, to the bounds \\nAnd crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, \\nRolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed \\nInto the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight \\nStruck them with horrour backward, but far worse \\nUrged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw \\nDown from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath \\nBurnt after them to the bottomless pit', ' \\nHell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw \\nHeaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled \\nAffrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep \\nHer dark foundations, and too fast had bound', ' \\nNine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared, \\nAnd felt tenfold confusion in their fall \\nThrough his wild anarchy, so huge a rout \\nIncumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last \\nYawning received them whole, and on them closed; \\nHell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire \\nUnquenchable, the house of woe and pain', ' \\nDisburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired \\nHer mural breach, returning whence it rolled', ' \\nSole victor, from the expulsion of his foes, \\nMessiah his triumphal chariot turned: \\nTo meet him all his Saints, who silent stood \\nEye-witnesses of his almighty acts, \\nWith jubilee advanced; and, as they went, \\nShaded with branching palm, each Order bright, \\nSung triumph, and him sung victorious King, \\nSon, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, \\nWorthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode \\nTriumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts \\nAnd temple of his Mighty Father throned \\nOn high; who into glory him received, \\nWhere now he sits at the right hand of bliss', ' \\nThus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth, \\nAt thy request, and that thou mayest beware \\nBy what is past, to thee I have revealed \\nWhat might have else to human race been hid; \\nThe discord which befel, and war in Heaven \\nAmong the angelick Powers, and the deep fall \\nOf those too high aspiring, who rebelled \\nWith Satan; he who envies now thy state, \\nWho now is plotting how he may seduce \\nThee also from obedience, that, with him \\nBereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake \\nHis punishment, eternal misery; \\nWhich would be all his solace and revenge, \\nAs a despite done against the Most High, \\nThee once to gain companion of his woe', ' \\nBut listen not to his temptations, warn \\nThy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, \\nBy terrible example, the reward \\nOf disobedience; firm they might have stood, \\nYet fell; remember, and fear to transgress', ' \\n \\n \\n \\nBook VII                                                         \\n \\n \\nDescend from Heaven, Urania, by that name \\nIf rightly thou art called, whose voice divine \\nFollowing, above the Olympian hill I soar, \\nAbove the flight of Pegasean wing', ' \\nThe meaning, not the name, I call: for thou \\nNor of the Muses nine, nor on the top \\nOf old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born, \\nBefore the hills appeared, or fountain flowed, \\nThou with eternal Wisdom didst converse, \\nWisdom thy sister, and with her didst play \\nIn presence of the Almighty Father, pleased \\nWith thy celestial song', '  Up led by thee \\nInto the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed, \\nAn earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air, \\nThy tempering: with like safety guided down \\nReturn me to my native element: \\nLest from this flying steed unreined, (as once \\nBellerophon, though from a lower clime,) \\nDismounted, on the Aleian field I fall, \\nErroneous there to wander, and forlorn', ' \\nHalf yet remains unsung, but narrower bound \\nWithin the visible diurnal sphere;

lest the like befall \\nIn Paradise to Adam or his race, \\nCharged not to touch the interdicted tree, \\nIf they transgress, and slight that sole command, \\nSo easily obeyed amid the choice \\nOf all tastes else to please their appetite, \\nThough wandering', '  He, with his consorted Eve, \\nThe story heard attentive, and was filled \\nWith admiration and deep muse, to hear \\nOf things so high and strange; things, to their thought \\nSo unimaginable, as hate in Heaven, \\nAnd war so near the peace of God in bliss, \\nWith such confusion: but the evil, soon \\nDriven back, redounded as a flood on those \\nFrom whom it sprung; impossible to mix \\nWith blessedness', '  Whence Adam soon repealed \\nThe doubts that in his heart arose: and now \\nLed on, yet sinless, with desire to know \\nWhat nearer might concern him, how this world \\nOf Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began; \\nWhen, and whereof created; for what cause; \\nWhat within Eden, or without, was done \\nBefore his memory; as one whose drouth \\nYet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, \\nWhose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, \\nProceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest', ' \\nGreat things, and full of wonder in our ears, \\nFar differing from this world, thou hast revealed, \\nDivine interpreter', ' by favour sent \\nDown from the empyrean, to forewarn \\nUs timely of what might else have been our loss, \\nUnknown, which human knowledge could not reach;

and this which yields or fills \\nAll space, the ambient air wide interfused \\nEmbracing round this floried Earth; what cause \\nMoved the Creator, in his holy rest \\nThrough all eternity, so late to build \\nIn Chaos; and the work begun, how soon \\nAbsolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold \\nWhat we, not to explore the secrets ask \\nOf his eternal empire, but the more \\nTo magnify his works, the more we know', ' \\nAnd the great light of day yet wants to run \\nMuch of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven, \\nHeld by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears, \\nAnd longer will delay to hear thee tell \\nHis generation, and the rising birth \\nOf Nature from the unapparent Deep: \\nOr if the star of evening and the moon \\nHaste to thy audience, Night with her will bring, \\nSilence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch; \\nOr we can bid his absence, till thy song \\nEnd, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine', ' \\nThus Adam his illustrious guest besought: \\nAnd thus the Godlike Angel answered mild', ' \\nThis also thy request, with caution asked, \\nObtain; though to recount almighty works \\nWhat words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, \\nOr heart of man suffice to comprehend', ' \\nYet what thou canst attain, which best may serve \\nTo glorify the Maker, and infer \\nThee also happier, shall not be withheld \\nThy hearing;

to Him \\nGlory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained \\nGood out of evil to create; instead \\nOf Spirits malign, a better race to bring \\nInto their vacant room, and thence diffuse \\nHis good to worlds and ages infinite\", ' \\nSo sang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son \\nOn his great expedition now appeared, \\nGirt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned \\nOf Majesty Divine; sapience and love \\nImmense, and all his Father in him shone', ' \\nAbout his chariot numberless were poured \\nCherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones, \\nAnd Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged \\nFrom the armoury of God;

\\nAnd said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds, \\nThis be thy just circumference, O World\", ' \\nThus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth, \\nMatter unformed and void:  Darkness profound \\nCovered the abyss: but on the watery calm \\nHis brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread, \\nAnd vital virtue infused, and vital warmth \\nThroughout the fluid mass; but downward purged \\nThe black tartareous cold infernal dregs, \\nAdverse to life: then founded, then conglobed \\nLike things to like; the rest to several place \\nDisparted, and between spun out the air;

she in a cloudy tabernacle \\nSojourned the while', '  God saw the light was good; \\nAnd light from darkness by the hemisphere \\nDivided: light the Day, and darkness Night, \\nHe named', '  Thus was the first day even and morn: \\nNor past uncelebrated, nor unsung \\nBy the celestial quires, when orient light \\nExhaling first from darkness they beheld;

lest fierce extremes \\nContiguous might distemper the whole frame: \\nAnd Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even \\nAnd morning chorus sung the second day', ' \\nThe Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet \\nOf waters, embryon immature involved, \\nAppeared not: over all the face of Earth \\nMain ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm \\nProlifick humour softening all her globe, \\nFermented the great mother to conceive, \\nSatiate with genial moisture; when God said, \\nBe gathered now ye waters under Heaven \\nInto one place, and let dry land appear', ' \\nImmediately the mountains huge appear \\nEmergent, and their broad bare backs upheave \\nInto the clouds; their tops ascend the sky: \\nSo high as heaved the tumid hills, so low \\nDown sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, \\nCapacious bed of waters:  Thither they \\nHasted with glad precipitance, uprolled, \\nAs drops on dust conglobing from the dry: \\nPart rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, \\nFor haste; such flight the great command impressed \\nOn the swift floods:  As armies at the call \\nOf trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard) \\nTroop to their standard; so the watery throng, \\nWave rolling after wave, where way they found, \\nIf steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, \\nSoft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; \\nBut they, or under ground, or circuit wide \\nWith serpent errour wandering, found their way, \\nAnd on the washy oose deep channels wore; \\nEasy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, \\nAll but within those banks, where rivers now \\nStream, and perpetual draw their humid train', ' \\nThe dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle \\nOf congregated waters, he called Seas: \\nAnd saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth \\nPut forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, \\nAnd fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, \\nWhose seed is in herself upon the Earth', ' \\nHe scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then \\nDesart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, \\nBrought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad \\nHer universal face with pleasant green; \\nThen herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered \\nOpening their various colours, and made gay \\nHer bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown, \\nForth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept \\nThe swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed \\nEmbattled in her field, and the humble shrub, \\nAnd bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last \\nRose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread \\nTheir branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed \\nTheir blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned; \\nWith tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; \\nWith borders long the rivers: that Earth now \\nSeemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, \\nOr wander with delight, and love to haunt \\nHer sacred shades: though God had yet not rained \\nUpon the Earth, and man to till the ground \\nNone was; but from the Earth a dewy mist \\nWent up, and watered all the ground, and each \\nPlant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth, \\nGod made, and every herb, before it grew \\nOn the green stem:  God saw that it was good: \\nSo even and morn recorded the third day', ' \\nAgain the Almighty spake, Let there be lights \\nHigh in the expanse of Heaven, to divide \\nThe day from night;

and made the stars, \\nAnd set them in the firmament of Heaven \\nTo illuminate the Earth, and rule the day \\nIn their vicissitude, and rule the night, \\nAnd light from darkness to divide', \"  God saw, \\nSurveying his great work, that it was good: \\nFor of celestial bodies first the sun \\nA mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first, \\nThough of ethereal mould: then formed the moon \\nGlobose, and every magnitude of stars, \\nAnd sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field: \\nOf light by far the greater part he took, \\nTransplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed \\nIn the sun's orb, made porous to receive \\nAnd drink the liquid light; firm to retain \\nHer gathered beams, great palace now of light\", \" \\nHither, as to their fountain, other stars \\nRepairing, in their golden urns draw light, \\nAnd hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;

the gray \\nDawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, \\nShedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon, \\nBut opposite in levelled west was set, \\nHis mirrour, with full face borrowing her light \\nFrom him; for other light she needed none \\nIn that aspect, and still that distance keeps \\nTill night; then in the east her turn she shines, \\nRevolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign \\nWith thousand lesser lights dividual holds, \\nWith thousand thousand stars, that then appeared \\nSpangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned \\nWith their bright luminaries that set and rose, \\nGlad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day\", ' \\nAnd God said, Let the waters generate \\nReptile with spawn abundant, living soul: \\nAnd let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings \\nDisplayed on the open firmament of Heaven', ' \\nAnd God created the great whales, and each \\nSoul living, each that crept, which plenteously \\nThe waters generated by their kinds;

so steers the prudent crane \\nHer annual voyage, borne on winds; the air \\nFloats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes: \\nFrom branch to branch the smaller birds with song \\nSolaced the woods, and spread their painted wings \\nTill even; nor then the solemn nightingale \\nCeased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays: \\nOthers, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed \\nTheir downy breast; the swan with arched neck, \\nBetween her white wings mantling proudly, rows \\nHer state with oary feet; yet oft they quit \\nThe dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower \\nThe mid aereal sky:  Others on ground \\nWalked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds \\nThe silent hours, and the other whose gay train \\nAdorns him, coloured with the florid hue \\nOf rainbows and starry eyes\", '  The waters thus \\nWith fish replenished, and the air with fowl, \\nEvening and morn solemnized the fifth day', ' \\nThe sixth, and of creation last, arose \\nWith evening harps and matin; when God said, \\nLet the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, \\nCattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth, \\nEach in their kind', '  The Earth obeyed, and straight \\nOpening her fertile womb teemed at a birth \\nInnumerous living creatures, perfect forms, \\nLimbed and full grown:  Out of the ground up rose, \\nAs from his lair, the wild beast where he wons \\nIn forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; \\nAmong the trees in pairs they rose, they walked: \\nThe cattle in the fields and meadows green: \\nThose rare and solitary, these in flocks \\nPasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung', ' \\nThe grassy clods now calved; now half appeared \\nThe tawny lion, pawing to get free \\nHis hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds, \\nAnd rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce, \\nThe libbard, and the tiger, as the mole \\nRising, the crumbled earth above them threw \\nIn hillocks:  The swift stag from under ground \\nBore up his branching head:  Scarce from his mould \\nBehemoth biggest born of earth upheaved \\nHis vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose, \\nAs plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land \\nThe river-horse, and scaly crocodile', \" \\nAt once came forth whatever creeps the ground, \\nInsect or worm: those waved their limber fans \\nFor wings, and smallest lineaments exact \\nIn all the liveries decked of summer's pride \\nWith spots of gold and purple, azure and green: \\nThese, as a line, their long dimension drew, \\nStreaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all \\nMinims of nature; some of serpent-kind, \\nWonderous in length and corpulence, involved \\nTheir snaky folds, and added wings\", '  First crept \\nThe parsimonious emmet, provident \\nOf future; in small room large heart enclosed; \\nPattern of just equality perhaps \\nHereafter, joined in her popular tribes \\nOf commonalty:  Swarming next appeared \\nThe female bee, that feeds her husband drone \\nDeliciously, and builds her waxen cells \\nWith honey stored:  The rest are numberless, \\nAnd thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names, \\nNeedless to thee repeated; nor unknown \\nThe serpent, subtlest beast of all the field, \\nOf huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes \\nAnd hairy mane terrifick, though to thee \\nNot noxious, but obedient at thy call', \" \\nNow Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled \\nHer motions, as the great first Mover's hand \\nFirst wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire \\nConsummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth, \\nBy fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked, \\nFrequent; and of the sixth day yet remained: \\nThere wanted yet the master-work, the end \\nOf all yet done; a creature, who, not prone \\nAnd brute as other creatures, but endued \\nWith sanctity of reason, might erect \\nHis stature, and upright with front serene \\nGovern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence \\nMagnanimous to correspond with Heaven, \\nBut grateful to acknowledge whence his good \\nDescends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes \\nDirected in devotion, to adore \\nAnd worship God Supreme, who made him chief \\nOf all his works:  therefore the Omnipotent \\nEternal Father (for where is not he \\nPresent\", ') thus to his Son audibly spake', ' \\nLet us make now Man in our image, Man \\nIn our similitude, and let them rule \\nOver the fish and fowl of sea and air, \\nBeast of the field, and over all the Earth, \\nAnd every creeping thing that creeps the ground', ' \\nThis said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man, \\nDust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed \\nThe breath of life; in his own image he \\nCreated thee, in the image of God \\nExpress; and thou becamest a living soul', ' \\nMale he created thee; but thy consort \\nFemale, for race; then blessed mankind, and said, \\nBe fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth; \\nSubdue it, and throughout dominion hold \\nOver fish of the sea, and fowl of the air, \\nAnd every living thing that moves on the Earth', ' \\nWherever thus created, for no place \\nIs yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest, \\nHe brought thee into this delicious grove, \\nThis garden, planted with the trees of God, \\nDelectable both to behold and taste; \\nAnd freely all their pleasant fruit for food \\nGave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields, \\nVariety without end; but of the tree, \\nWhich, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil, \\nThou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest; \\nDeath is the penalty imposed; beware, \\nAnd govern well thy appetite; lest Sin \\nSurprise thee, and her black attendant Death', ' \\nHere finished he, and all that he had made \\nViewed, and behold all was entirely good; \\nSo even and morn accomplished the sixth day: \\nYet not till the Creator from his work \\nDesisting, though unwearied, up returned, \\nUp to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode; \\nThence to behold this new created world, \\nThe addition of his empire, how it showed \\nIn prospect from his throne, how good, how fair, \\nAnswering his great idea', '  Up he rode \\nFollowed with acclamation, and the sound \\nSymphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned \\nAngelick harmonies:  The earth, the air \\nResounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,) \\nThe heavens and all the constellations rung, \\nThe planets in their station listening stood, \\nWhile the bright pomp ascended jubilant', ' \\nOpen, ye everlasting gates', ' they sung, \\nOpen, ye Heavens', ' your living doors;let in \\nThe great Creator from his work returned \\nMagnificent, his six days work, a World;

and, from work \\nNow resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day, \\nAs resting on that day from all his work, \\nBut not in silence holy kept: the harp \\nHad work and rested not; the solemn pipe, \\nAnd dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, \\nAll sounds on fret by string or golden wire, \\nTempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice \\nChoral or unison: of incense clouds, \\nFuming from golden censers, hid the mount\", ' \\nCreation and the six days acts they sung: \\nGreat are thy works, Jehovah', ' infinite \\nThy power', ' what thought can measure thee, or tongue \\nRelate thee', '  Greater now in thy return \\nThan from the giant Angels:  Thee that day \\nThy thunders magnified; but to create \\nIs greater than created to destroy', ' \\nWho can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound \\nThy empire', '  Easily the proud attempt \\nOf Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain, \\nThou hast repelled; while impiously they thought \\nThee to diminish, and from thee withdraw \\nThe number of thy worshippers', '  Who seeks \\nTo lessen thee, against his purpose serves \\nTo manifest the more thy might: his evil \\nThou usest, and from thence createst more good', ' \\nWitness this new-made world, another Heaven \\nFrom Heaven-gate not far, founded in view \\nOn the clear hyaline, the glassy sea; \\nOf amplitude almost immense, with stars \\nNumerous, and every star perhaps a world \\nOf destined habitation; but thou knowest \\nTheir seasons: among these the seat of Men, \\nEarth, with her nether ocean circumfused, \\nTheir pleasant dwelling-place', '  Thrice happy Men, \\nAnd sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced', ' \\nCreated in his image, there to dwell \\nAnd worship him;

for on her, as Queen, \\nA pomp of winning Graces waited still, \\nAnd from about her shot darts of desire \\nInto all eyes, to wish her still in sight', \" \\nAnd Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed, \\nBenevolent and facile thus replied\", \" \\nTo ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven \\nIs as the book of God before thee set, \\nWherein to read his wonderous works, and learn \\nHis seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years: \\nThis to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth, \\nImports not, if thou reckon right;

\\nWhose virtue on itself works no effect, \\nBut in the fruitful Earth; there first received, \\nHis beams, unactive else, their vigour find\", \" \\nYet not to Earth are those bright luminaries \\nOfficious; but to thee, Earth's habitant\", \" \\nAnd for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak \\nThe Maker's high magnificence, who built \\nSo spacious, and his line stretched out so far; \\nThat Man may know he dwells not in his own; \\nAn edifice too large for him to fill, \\nLodged in a small partition; and the rest \\nOrdained for uses to his Lord best known\", ' \\nThe swiftness of those circles attribute, \\nThough numberless, to his Omnipotence, \\nThat to corporeal substances could add \\nSpeed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow, \\nWho since the morning-hour set out from Heaven \\nWhere God resides, and ere mid-day arrived \\nIn Eden; distance inexpressible \\nBy numbers that have name', '  But this I urge, \\nAdmitting motion in the Heavens, to show \\nInvalid that which thee to doubt it moved; \\nNot that I so affirm, though so it seem \\nTo thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth', ' \\nGod, to remove his ways from human sense, \\nPlaced Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight, \\nIf it presume, might err in things too high, \\nAnd no advantage gain', '  What if the sun \\nBe center to the world; and other stars, \\nBy his attractive virtue and their own \\nIncited, dance about him various rounds', ' \\nTheir wandering course now high, now low, then hid, \\nProgressive, retrograde, or standing still, \\nIn six thou seest;

and other suns perhaps, \\nWith their attendant moons, thou wilt descry, \\nCommunicating male and female light; \\nWhich two great sexes animate the world, \\nStored in each orb perhaps with some that live', ' \\nFor such vast room in Nature unpossessed \\nBy living soul, desart and desolate, \\nOnly to shine, yet scarce to contribute \\nEach orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far \\nDown to this habitable, which returns \\nLight back to them, is obvious to dispute', ' \\nBut whether thus these things, or whether not;

\\nContented that thus far hath been revealed \\nNot of Earth only, but of highest Heaven', ' \\nTo whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied', ' \\nHow fully hast thou satisfied me, pure \\nIntelligence of Heaven, Angel serene', ' \\nAnd, freed from intricacies, taught to live \\nThe easiest way;

which with his beams the sun \\nSoon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed', \" \\nStraight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, \\nAnd gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised \\nBy quick instinctive motion, up I sprung, \\nAs thitherward endeavouring, and upright \\nStood on my feet: about me round I saw \\nHill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains, \\nAnd liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, \\nCreatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew; \\nBirds on the branches warbling; all things smiled; \\nWith fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed\", \" \\nMyself I then perused, and limb by limb \\nSurveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran \\nWith supple joints, as lively vigour led: \\nBut who I was, or where, or from what cause, \\nKnew not;

rise, \\n'First Man, of men innumerable ordained \\n'First Father\", \" called by thee, I come thy guide \\n'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared\", \"' \\nSo saying, by the hand he took me raised, \\nAnd over fields and waters, as in air \\nSmooth-sliding without step, last led me up \\nA woody mountain; whose high top was plain, \\nA circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees \\nPlanted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw \\nOf Earth before scarce pleasant seemed\", '  Each tree, \\nLoaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye \\nTempting, stirred in me sudden appetite \\nTo pluck and eat;

\\nSo fitly them in pairs thou hast combined: \\nMuch less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl \\nSo well converse, nor with the ox the ape; \\nWorse then can man with beast, and least of all', ' \\nWhereto the Almighty answered, not displeased', ' \\nA nice and subtle happiness, I see, \\nThou to thyself proposest, in the choice \\nOf thy associates, Adam', ' and wilt taste \\nNo pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary', ' \\nWhat thinkest thou then of me, and this my state', ' \\nSeem I to thee sufficiently possessed \\nOf happiness, or not', ' who am alone \\nFrom all eternity;

I lowly answered', '  To attain \\nThe highth and depth of thy eternal ways \\nAll human thoughts come short, Supreme of things', ' \\nThou in thyself art perfect, and in thee \\nIs no deficience found:  Not so is Man, \\nBut in degree;

wide was the wound, \\nBut suddenly with flesh filled up and healed: \\nThe rib he formed and fashioned with his hands; \\nUnder his forming hands a creature grew, \\nMan-like, but different sex; so lovely fair, \\nThat what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now \\nMean, or in her summed up, in her contained \\nAnd in her looks; which from that time infused \\nSweetness into my heart, unfelt before, \\nAnd into all things from her air inspired \\nThe spirit of love and amorous delight', ' \\nShe disappeared, and left me dark; I waked \\nTo find her, or for ever to deplore \\nHer loss, and other pleasures all abjure: \\nWhen out of hope, behold her, not far off, \\nSuch as I saw her in my dream, adorned \\nWith what all Earth or Heaven could bestow \\nTo make her amiable:  On she came, \\nLed by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, \\nAnd guided by his voice; nor uninformed \\nOf nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites: \\nGrace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, \\nIn every gesture dignity and love', ' \\nI, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud', ' \\nThis turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled \\nThy words, Creator bounteous and benign, \\nGiver of all things fair', ' but fairest this \\nOf all thy gifts', ' nor enviest', '  I now see \\nBone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself \\nBefore me:  Woman is her name;of Man \\nExtracted: for this cause he shall forego \\nFather and mother, and to his wife adhere;

\\nSome tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed, \\nAnd girded on our loins, may cover round \\nThose middle parts; that this new comer, Shame, \\nThere sit not, and reproach us as unclean', ' \\nSo counselled he, and both together went \\nInto the thickest wood; there soon they chose \\nThe fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned, \\nBut such as at this day, to Indians known, \\nIn Malabar or Decan spreads her arms \\nBranching so broad and long, that in the ground \\nThe bended twigs take root, and daughters grow \\nAbout the mother tree, a pillared shade \\nHigh over-arched, and echoing walks between: \\nThere oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat, \\nShelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds \\nAt loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves \\nThey gathered, broad as Amazonian targe; \\nAnd, with what skill they had, together sewed, \\nTo gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide \\nTheir guilt and dreaded shame', '  O, how unlike \\nTo that first naked glory', '  Such of late \\nColumbus found the American, so girt \\nWith feathered cincture; naked else, and wild \\nAmong the trees on isles and woody shores', ' \\nThus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part \\nCovered, but not at rest or ease of mind, \\nThey sat them down to weep; nor only tears \\nRained at their eyes, but high winds worse within \\nBegan to rise, high passions, anger, hate, \\nMistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore \\nTheir inward state of mind, calm region once \\nAnd full of peace, now tost and turbulent: \\nFor Understanding ruled not, and the Will \\nHeard not her lore; both in subjection now \\nTo sensual Appetite, who from beneath \\nUsurping over sovran Reason claimed \\nSuperiour sway: From thus distempered breast, \\nAdam, estranged in look and altered style, \\nSpeech intermitted thus to Eve renewed', ' \\nWould thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid \\nWith me, as I besought thee, when that strange \\nDesire of wandering, this unhappy morn, \\nI know not whence possessed thee; we had then \\nRemained still happy; not, as now, despoiled \\nOf all our good; shamed, naked, miserable', ' \\nLet none henceforth seek needless cause to approve \\nThe faith they owe; when earnestly they seek \\nSuch proof, conclude, they then begin to fail', ' \\nTo whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve', ' \\nWhat words have passed thy lips, Adam severe', ' \\nImputest thou that to my default, or will \\nOf wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows \\nBut might as ill have happened thou being by, \\nOr to thyself perhaps', '  Hadst thou been there, \\nOr here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned \\nFraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; \\nNo ground of enmity between us known, \\nWhy he should mean me ill, or seek to harm', ' \\nWas I to have never parted from thy side', ' \\nAs good have grown there still a lifeless rib', ' \\nBeing as I am, why didst not thou, the head, \\nCommand me absolutely not to go, \\nGoing into such danger, as thou saidst', ' \\nToo facile then, thou didst not much gainsay; \\nNay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss', ' \\nHadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent, \\nNeither had I transgressed, nor thou with me', ' \\nTo whom, then first incensed, Adam replied', ' \\nIs this the love, is this the recompence \\nOf mine to thee, ingrateful Eve', ' expressed \\nImmutable, when thou wert lost, not I; \\nWho might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss, \\nYet willingly chose rather death with thee', ' \\nAnd am I now upbraided as the cause \\nOf thy transgressing', '  Not enough severe, \\nIt seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more \\nI warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold \\nThe danger, and the lurking enemy \\nThat lay in wait; beyond this, had been force; \\nAnd force upon free will hath here no place', ' \\nBut confidence then bore thee on; secure \\nEither to meet no danger, or to find \\nMatter of glorious trial; and perhaps \\nI also erred, in overmuch admiring \\nWhat seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought \\nNo evil durst attempt thee;

from whence \\nEden, and all the coast, in prospect lay', ' \\nDown he descended straight; the speed of Gods \\nTime counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged', ' \\nNow was the sun in western cadence low \\nFrom noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour, \\nTo fan the earth now waked, and usher in \\nThe evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool, \\nCame the mild Judge, and Intercessour both, \\nTo sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard \\nNow walking in the garden, by soft winds \\nBrought to their ears, while day declined; they heard, \\nAnd from his presence hid themselves among \\nThe thickest trees, both man and wife; till God, \\nApproaching, thus to Adam called aloud', ' \\nWhere art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet \\nMy coming seen far off', '  I miss thee here, \\nNot pleased, thus entertained with solitude, \\nWhere obvious duty ere while appeared unsought: \\nOr come I less conspicuous, or what change \\nAbsents thee, or what chance detains', '--Come forth', ' \\nHe came;

how is it now become \\nSo dreadful to thee', '  That thou art naked, who \\nHath told thee', '  Hast thou eaten of the tree, \\nWhereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat', ' \\nTo whom thus Adam sore beset replied', ' \\nO Heaven', ' in evil strait this day I stand \\nBefore my Judge; either to undergo \\nMyself the total crime, or to accuse \\nMy other self, the partner of my life; \\nWhose failing, while her faith to me remains, \\nI should conceal, and not expose to blame \\nBy my complaint: but strict necessity \\nSubdues me, and calamitous constraint; \\nLest on my head both sin and punishment, \\nHowever insupportable, be all \\nDevolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou \\nWouldst easily detect what I conceal', '-- \\nThis Woman, whom thou madest to be my help, \\nAnd gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good, \\nSo fit, so acceptable, so divine, \\nThat from her hand I could suspect no ill, \\nAnd what she did, whatever in itself, \\nHer doing seemed to justify the deed; \\nShe gave me of the tree, and I did eat', ' \\nTo whom the Sovran Presence thus replied', ' \\nWas she thy God, that her thou didst obey \\nBefore his voice', ' or was she made thy guide, \\nSuperiour, or but equal, that to her \\nThou didst resign thy manhood, and the place \\nWherein God set thee above her made of thee, \\nAnd for thee, whose perfection far excelled \\nHers in all real dignity', '  Adorned \\nShe was indeed, and lovely, to attract \\nThy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts \\nWere such, as under government well seemed; \\nUnseemly to bear rule; which was thy part \\nAnd person, hadst thou known thyself aright', ' \\nSo having said, he thus to Eve in few', ' \\nSay, Woman, what is this which thou hast done', ' \\nTo whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, \\nConfessing soon, yet not before her Judge \\nBold or loquacious, thus abashed replied', ' \\nThe Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat', ' \\nWhich when the Lord God heard, without delay \\nTo judgement he proceeded on the accused \\nSerpent, though brute; unable to transfer \\nThe guilt on him, who made him instrument \\nOf mischief, and polluted from the end \\nOf his creation; justly then accursed, \\nAs vitiated in nature:  More to know \\nConcerned not Man, (since he no further knew) \\nNor altered his offence; yet God at last \\nTo Satan first in sin his doom applied, \\nThough in mysterious terms, judged as then best: \\nAnd on the Serpent thus his curse let fall', ' \\nBecause thou hast done this, thou art accursed \\nAbove all cattle, each beast of the field; \\nUpon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, \\nAnd dust shalt eat all the days of thy life', ' \\nBetween thee and the woman I will put \\nEnmity, and between thine and her seed; \\nHer seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel', ' \\nSo spake this oracle, then verified \\nWhen Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve, \\nSaw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven, \\nPrince of the air; then, rising from his grave \\nSpoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed \\nIn open show; and, with ascension bright, \\nCaptivity led captive through the air, \\nThe realm itself of Satan, long usurped; \\nWhom he shall tread at last under our feet; \\nEven he, who now foretold his fatal bruise; \\nAnd to the Woman thus his sentence turned', \" \\nThy sorrow I will greatly multiply \\nBy thy conception; children thou shalt bring \\nIn sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will \\nThine shall submit; he over thee shall rule\", ' \\nOn Adam last thus judgement he pronounced', ' \\nBecause thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, \\nAnd eaten of the tree, concerning which \\nI charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof: \\nCursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow \\nShalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life; \\nThorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth \\nUnbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; \\nIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, \\nTill thou return unto the ground; for thou \\nOut of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, \\nFor dust thou art, and shalt to dust return', ' \\nSo judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent; \\nAnd the instant stroke of death, denounced that day, \\nRemoved far off; then, pitying how they stood \\nBefore him naked to the air, that now \\nMust suffer change, disdained not to begin \\nThenceforth the form of servant to assume; \\nAs when he washed his servants feet; so now, \\nAs father of his family, he clad \\nTheir nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, \\nOr as the snake with youthful coat repaid; \\nAnd thought not much to clothe his enemies; \\nNor he their outward only with the skins \\nOf beasts, but inward nakedness, much more', \" \\nOpprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, \\nArraying, covered from his Father's sight\", ' \\nTo him with swift ascent he up returned, \\nInto his blissful bosom reassumed \\nIn glory, as of old; to him appeased \\nAll, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man \\nRecounted, mixing intercession sweet', ' \\nMean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, \\nWithin the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, \\nIn counterview within the gates, that now \\nStood open wide, belching outrageous flame \\nFar into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through, \\nSin opening; who thus now to Death began', ' \\nO Son, why sit we here each other viewing \\nIdly, while Satan, our great author, thrives \\nIn other worlds, and happier seat provides \\nFor us, his offspring dear', '  It cannot be \\nBut that success attends him; if mishap, \\nEre this he had returned, with fury driven \\nBy his avengers; since no place like this \\nCan fit his punishment, or their revenge', ' \\nMethinks I feel new strength within me rise, \\nWings growing, and dominion given me large \\nBeyond this deep; whatever draws me on, \\nOr sympathy, or some connatural force, \\nPowerful at greatest distance to unite, \\nWith secret amity, things of like kind, \\nBy secretest conveyance', '  Thou, my shade \\nInseparable, must with me along; \\nFor Death from Sin no power can separate', ' \\nBut, lest the difficulty of passing back \\nStay his return perhaps over this gulf \\nImpassable, impervious; let us try \\nAdventurous work, yet to thy power and mine \\nNot unagreeable, to found a path \\nOver this main from Hell to that new world, \\nWhere Satan now prevails; a monument \\nOf merit high to all the infernal host, \\nEasing their passage hence, for intercourse, \\nOr transmigration, as their lot shall lead', ' \\nNor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn \\nBy this new-felt attraction and instinct', ' \\nWhom thus the meager Shadow answered soon', ' \\nGo, whither Fate, and inclination strong, \\nLeads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err \\nThe way, thou leading; such a scent I draw \\nOf carnage, prey innumerable, and taste \\nThe savour of death from all things there that live: \\nNor shall I to the work thou enterprisest \\nBe wanting, but afford thee equal aid', ' \\nSo saying, with delight he snuffed the smell \\nOf mortal change on earth', '  As when a flock \\nOf ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, \\nAgainst the day of battle, to a field, \\nWhere armies lie encamped, come flying, lured \\nWith scent of living carcasses designed \\nFor death, the following day, in bloody fight: \\nSo scented the grim Feature, and upturned \\nHis nostril wide into the murky air; \\nSagacious of his quarry from so far', ' \\nThen both from out Hell-gates, into the waste \\nWide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark, \\nFlew diverse; and with power (their power was great) \\nHovering upon the waters, what they met \\nSolid or slimy, as in raging sea \\nTost up and down, together crouded drove, \\nFrom each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell; \\nAs when two polar winds, blowing adverse \\nUpon the Cronian sea, together drive \\nMountains of ice, that stop the imagined way \\nBeyond Petsora eastward, to the rich \\nCathaian coast', '  The aggregated soil \\nDeath with his mace petrifick, cold and dry, \\nAs with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm \\nAs Delos, floating once; the rest his look \\nBound with Gorgonian rigour not to move; \\nAnd with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate, \\nDeep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach \\nThey fastened, and the mole immense wrought on \\nOver the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge \\nOf length prodigious, joining to the wall \\nImmoveable of this now fenceless world, \\nForfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, \\nSmooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell', ' \\nSo, if great things to small may be compared, \\nXerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, \\nFrom Susa, his Memnonian palace high, \\nCame to the sea: and, over Hellespont \\nBridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, \\nAnd scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves', ' \\nNow had they brought the work by wonderous art \\nPontifical, a ridge of pendant rock, \\nOver the vexed abyss, following the track \\nOf Satan to the self-same place where he \\nFirst lighted from his wing, and landed safe \\nFrom out of Chaos, to the outside bare \\nOf this round world:  With pins of adamant \\nAnd chains they made all fast, too fast they made \\nAnd durable', '  And now in little space \\nThe confines met of empyrean Heaven, \\nAnd of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell \\nWith long reach interposed; three several ways \\nIn sight, to each of these three places led', ' \\nAnd now their way to Earth they had descried, \\nTo Paradise first tending; when, behold', ' \\nSatan, in likeness of an Angel bright, \\nBetwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering \\nHis zenith, while the sun in Aries rose: \\nDisguised he came; but those his children dear \\nTheir parent soon discerned, though in disguise', ' \\nHe, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk \\nInto the wood fast by; and, changing shape, \\nTo observe the sequel, saw his guileful act \\nBy Eve, though all unweeting, seconded \\nUpon her husband; saw their shame that sought \\nVain covertures; but when he saw descend \\nThe Son of God to judge them, terrified \\nHe fled; not hoping to escape, but shun \\nThe present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath \\nMight suddenly inflict; that past, returned \\nBy night, and listening where the hapless pair \\nSat in their sad discourse, and various plaint, \\nThence gathered his own doom; which understood \\nNot instant, but of future time, with joy \\nAnd tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned; \\nAnd at the brink of Chaos, near the foot \\nOf this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped \\nMet, who to meet him came, his offspring dear', ' \\nGreat joy was at their meeting, and at sight \\nOf that stupendious bridge his joy encreased', ' \\nLong he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair \\nEnchanting daughter, thus the silence broke', ' \\nO Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, \\nThy trophies', ' which thou viewest as not thine own;

go, and be strong', ' \\nSo saying he dismissed them; they with speed \\nTheir course through thickest constellations held, \\nSpreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, \\nAnd planets, planet-struck, real eclipse \\nThen suffered', '  The other way Satan went down \\nThe causey to Hell-gate:  On either side \\nDisparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed, \\nAnd with rebounding surge the bars assailed, \\nThat scorned his indignation:  Through the gate, \\nWide open and unguarded, Satan passed, \\nAnd all about found desolate; for those, \\nAppointed to sit there, had left their charge, \\nFlown to the upper world; the rest were all \\nFar to the inland retired, about the walls \\nOf Pandemonium; city and proud seat \\nOf Lucifer, so by allusion called \\nOf that bright star to Satan paragoned;

and also arm \\nWith spiritual armour, able to resist \\nSatan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts; \\nWhat man can do against them, not afraid, \\nThough to the death; against such cruelties \\nWith inward consolations recompensed, \\nAnd oft supported so as shall amaze \\nTheir proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit, \\nPoured first on his Apostles, whom he sends \\nTo evangelize the nations, then on all \\nBaptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue \\nTo speak all tongues, and do all miracles, \\nAs did their Lord before them\", '  Thus they win \\nGreat numbers of each nation to receive \\nWith joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length \\nTheir ministry performed, and race well run, \\nTheir doctrine and their story written left, \\nThey die; but in their room, as they forewarn, \\nWolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, \\nWho all the sacred mysteries of Heaven \\nTo their own vile advantages shall turn \\nOf lucre and ambition;

\\nTo bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss\", ' \\nHe ended; and thus Adam last replied', ' \\nHow soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, \\nMeasured this transient world, the race of time, \\nTill time stand fixed', '  Beyond is all abyss, \\nEternity, whose end no eye can reach', ' \\nGreatly-instructed I shall hence depart;

yet much more cheered \\nWith meditation on the happy end\", ' \\nHe ended, and they both descend the hill; \\nDescended, Adam to the bower, where Eve \\nLay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked; \\nAnd thus with words not sad she him received', \" \\nWhence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know; \\nFor God is also in sleep; and dreams advise, \\nWhich he hath sent propitious, some great good \\nPresaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress \\nWearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on;

\\nThe world was all before them, where to choose \\nTheir place of rest, and Providence their guide: \\nThey, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, \\nThrough Eden took their solitary way', ' \\n \\n[The End]\\x1a\\x1a\\n']\n"
