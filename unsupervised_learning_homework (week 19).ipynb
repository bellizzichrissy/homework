    "Supervised learning involves building and training a model based on inputs and corresponding outputs.  Problems addressed with supervised learning generally fall under one of two categories: classification or regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression, like its name applies, tries to model the relationship of two variables (one independent, one dependent) by fitting a line to the coordinate points of a dataset.  The resulting equation can be written in the slope-intercept format of y = mx + b: x represents the independent variable, y is the dependent variable, m is the slope of the regression line, and b is the coordinate of the y-intercept (when x=0).  Pros: computationally efficient, easy to visualize and understand.  Cons: can be too simplistic for some real-world applications; can be very affected/skewed by outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a \"lazy learning\" supervised learning method.  It operates under the principle that data points in the same vicinity (within a given area or cluster) will have similar characteristics.  Given known groupings of data, the algorithm compares the traits of an input datapoint to the characteristics of the known groupings, and predicts which grouping the input belongs to based on which group it most closely resembles.  Pros: Fast at training.  Cons: Slower at predicting, and not the most computationally efficient (must store dataset in memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Classifiers are a family of supervised learning methods that, at their most basic, divide datasets using lines, hence the \"linear\" description.  While they naturally deal with linearly separable data (binary classification problems), they can be modified to be used for non-linear purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression models the chance or probability of a given data point belonging to one of two groups (binary classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a bit like KNN as they are both grouping approaches.  With SVM, you're looking for a hyperplane or decision boundary that splits the data points into two separate groups or classes.  Thus, this model works well for binary classification problems and linearly separable data (though it can be used on non-linearly separable data using the kernel trick).  Pros: Fast compared to logistic regression and neural networks; performs well with relatively small quantities of data.  Cons: Don't directly yield answers/percentages for probability problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree: This supervised learning model resembles a flow chart.  Beginning with a root node, each node poses a binary question or test to the data; the two prongs forking off of each node represent data that did or did not meet the criteria of the test.  A node might classify a data point as true/false, being less than/greater than a given quantity, etc.  Continuing the tree metaphor, \"branches\" are the prongs that fork off each node.  Once you hit a point where the data doesn't split any further (aka, no further useful information can be gained by branching again), the terminal forks are called \"leaves.\"  Pros: Binary structure is fairly easy to comprehend and visualize; doesn't require a ton of data preprocessing. Cons: Not the most reliable/accurate supervised learning method; can be prone to overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods: General approach to machine learning where several methods/models are used \"in concert\" with each other for more harmonious (aka accurate) results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest: Ensemble learning method that harnesses the power of a large number (\"forest\") of decision trees.  Predictions/classifications are decided by how the majority of the trees \"vote.\"  Pros: With no one tree holding all the decision-making power, random forests are less likely to overfit than decision trees."

    "Unsupervised learning tries to discern patterns in data where there is no concrete output goal - aka, there isn't a specified relationship between independent and dependent variables at the outset.  Framing it another way: supervised learning uses labeled input data, while the data used in unsupervised learning is generally unlabeled.  These methods can be used for association, clustering, and dimensionality reduction problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to scale down a dataset to its most essential elements (or \"principal components\") with minimal information loss.  Pros: simplifies complex data sets for easier comprehension/manipulation.  Cons: That simplicity comes with a tradeoff of losing some accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "K Means: a clustering technique where \"k\" represents the number of clusters observed in the data.  The so-called elbow method can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters.  Each cluster has a central point or centroid, and data points are clustered according to which centroid they are closest to.  Cons: Because the centroids are randomly chosen each time the algorithm is run, it may need to be run multiple times and the results averaged to avoid potential distortion/skewing."
